Graduating from a national university, I somehow managed to make my way into the corporate world. This is a businessman's town. I get my ass kicked by my boss all day. But at the same time, I hope to be in this place someday. It's the only way to maintain your sanity here. This is the city of winter, where I once lived. It all seems so far away. Right now, all that's in front of me is the shimmering water of the South China Sea, the stirring winds- Aargh!

All right, Mr. Japanese, I'll ask you one more time. The package you got from the Asahi Industry headquarters in Tokyo - the one you're in charge of until you hand it over to the chief in Borneo - this is it, right?

Yeah... But what I want to know is...

We're all done with you now. You've given us what we wanted.

Dutch, this is a pain in the ass. I say we kneecap this pussy. There'll be no secrets after that.

There's no need. That one disk is more than enough for the compensation.

You call that compensation?

Dutch. Hey, Dutch! You through with them yet? There's someone heading straight for us from Supick Bay. It's probably a patrol boat from the Filipino Navy.

Don't panic, Benny-Boy, it's all been taken care of. Start the engines.

(initiating engine)

Now listen up, gentlemen! We're going to disappear, then you'll all be free to go. But I'm warning you - the deal's off if anyone decides to come after us. What you see there is a torpedo launcher. If you don't wanna follow home what's left of your ship, I recommend you stay put for the next half hour. After that you're free to do as you wish.

(sighs) We're going to live...

Why are you looking so relaxed? You're gonna tag along with us. Dumbass.

You're joking. You're joking, right?

You shut up and walk.

You're joking, right?! Japan is drifting further away.

This is Black Lagoon to Balalaika. Can you hear me?

Just fine, Dutch. What about the catch?

I've got it, of course.

I admire smart work, Dutch. The trade-off goes as planned.

Yes, just as I promised. (dialing) Connect me to Tokyo.


Well, Kageyama, as Resource Investigation Division Manager, how do you explain this?

Regarding the case we've recently been informed of, let me explain the situation to you in greater detail. Today at approximately 4 pm, a certain Burgenbiria trade company contacted us wishing to negotiate an agreement for the safe return of our disk, which was stolen from the Meramarsia earlier today.

What's the story on this company?

They're the Russian Mafia. Well... to be exact, they're a front for the branch that aims to take top position after completely displacing the Chinese Mafia from Southeast Asia.

What are they looking for specifically? Do they want money?

Most likely the route to Southeast Asia where the barter is going to take place. They no doubt wish to take part in some of our more unsavory trade activities in that area. It's a regrettable development.

Blackmail.

It's shameful that we're vulnerable to blackmail.

Based on what we've heard so far, it would seem to me that, at this point anyway, they don't really know what's on the disk.

If they ever found out, it would lead to the worst scandal in Asahi Industries' history.

Indeed.

We have just received a report from Jakarta. According to a local Chinese merchant we've been speaking to, the Russian Mafia has yet to receive the disk. It is still in the hands of the pirates that attacked the Meramarsia. This is our chance. We simply cannot trust the word of the Mafia on this. We must get the disk at all costs before it reaches them.

Hmm...

Before it reaches them? But how?

(clears throat) I understand. The board will leave this matter in your hands, Kageyama. Choosing what actions to take will also be your responsibility.


Revy, what in the hell are you planning to do with this hostage now that you've brought him with us, huh?! Come on!

You don't get it, do ya? You just don't get it, do ya, Dutch! Think about it! We're getting paid twenty grand for this job! Only twenty grand! Huh, what's wrong with collecting a bonus by asking for a ransom?

You're being too simple-minded.

You wanna die, Benny?!

Not really.

So, who's going to negotiate with Japan? You? Do you have their phone number? How about a bank account to receive the ransom payment?

(growls) Ahhh, fine then! We'll just shoot his ass and throw him overboard!

Stop it!

Damn it! Don't damage the ship!

Shut up!

Dutch. Dutch, I get it.

You get what?

I get your point now, so let me go.

OK, Revy. Let's play it cool.

Hmph.

(pants) I'm alive... I don't know why, but somehow I'm alive...

All right, all right. Let's go topside for a smoke.


What's going to happen to me?

I guess we'll make contact with your company somehow and then we'll try to set up a trade.

There's going to be a ransom, huh? This will go on my permanent record...

But we have our own priorities, and that's just the way it is. Getting the disk to our client has got to come first.

So there's a client. Now I get it.

We're nothing more than delivery boys. Sometimes we break the rules to put food on the table. But that's business.

I guess this must be what they call the Stockholm Syndrome. Right now, I feel like this big guy next to me is the only person I can trust in the entire world.

What's your name?

Okajima. Rokuro Okajima.


What's the name of that employee?

It's Okajima, sir. Rokuro Okajima.

My managerial skills are completely to blame for all of this, sir.

Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

Uh... I was only informed recently myself, sir. A-And because there were no other employees we could trust with this sensitive information, w-we ended up losing valuable time in confirming our sources...

That's enough. Kageyama, what are your thoughts?

Our company is currently facing a crisis. And I'm afraid we can't accept any more delays at this point. The E.O. Company, with whom we've made a confidential contract, has already sent their professionals.

Well, it was your responsibility after all. But I do feel bad for this employee. What's his name?

It's Okajima, sir. Rokuro Okajima.


So, you gonna join us, Rock?

Rock?

I think he means you.

Huh...

So, you comin' or what?

What? Where are you going?

Some place to get a drink. Don't you want to come?

But... aren't I a hostage?

We're leavin'.

Wait! I'm coming too! ...But where on Earth am I?

I just don't get it. Why is there a gun on every table? Is this the so-called bar at the end of the world you see in Westerns?

Good analogy. This place was founded by the Southern Vietnamese soldiers who survived the War. They started taking in fugitive soldiers too, and before we knew it, the place had gone straight to hell. Hookers, junkies, mercenaries, hitmen... Irredeemable criminals - every one of them. Don't like it?

Japanese pubs... I don't know... I just love those unguarded smiles. Places like this...

Shut the fuck up before I toss your ass outta here, damn it!

I usually try to avoid confrontations.

Your expression says it all. Benny, I'm going to make a call.

Sure. Dutch sure is a little bit unusual. After being around him for two years all I can tell you is that he's tough, intelligent and eccentric. You can give up on trying to figure him out.

Got it. You seem different from the other people around here. Where did you come from?

A college in Florida. I was fooling around and managed to piss off the Mafia and the FBI at the same time. And then...

Yours truly stepped in and saved his ass before he was stuffed in a bag and thrown overboard. Stop the worthless storytelling. You're too young to be reminiscing. Now, it's time for all of us to go shot-for-shot. We came all the way here for a drink, let's talk about something a little more interesting, Mr. Japanese.

This is...?

Heh heh...

(gulp)(sigh) If you ask me, beer's no different from piss. That stuff will never get you drunk. A real man takes rum. But... if you don't even have the balls to keep up with a woman, then I'm not going to try and force you. Though I might want to put a little dress on you and some pretty ribbons to take you out for a night of dancing. Hm?

As a rule, I hate chugging drinks like some teenager! But I'll make an exception... (gulp, gulp)

Huh!

I was forced to drink at college. We're forced to drink at company social events. Never underestimate a Japanese businessman!

(grunts) Why, you...

(smirks)

(growls) Hey, bartender!

Bring us all the Bacardi you've got right now!

Geez, in all this time here I was thinking you didn't like confrontations.


No shit. That's definitely not good news. Yeah, go on.

Something wasn't right about Asahi Industries' response. So I left out some bait, and a Chinese rat went right for it. In fact, I'm talking to it now.

Who's on the move?

One moment. What's your owner's name? Loud and clear.

(groans) Shinginan - Shinginan's Wan Taikei! He sent his troops to assassinate them! He sent mercenaries to Roanapur!

Hear that?

Yeah. Not good.

Tell me the number and affiliation of those soldiers. Speak up and make it fast.

Guys from Extra Order, a mercenary contracting agency! I don't know how many there are!

The E.O. Company scouts experienced war junkies.

Just our luck.

Try not to die.

Let's get started.


BLACK
LAGOON


OK. Let's do it, boys. Let's crash this party.

Give anyone trying to escape an extra asshole. Make sure there are only corpses left when we're done here.

Revy! If these assholes are your friends then you better deal with them!

Don't know them. Wow, you've bulletproofed the bar, huh?

Yup. It can handle up to a .50 caliber.

Revy!

I'm OK!

Benny!

Miraculously, I'm alive!

And Rock?

Dead! People are dead! I went to all the trouble of graduating a college and got a job with a big corporation! Where am I now?! This isn't fair!

Don't cry, dipshit. Don't you know you got to enjoy your life? Or it'll slip away.

Revy! I think now is a good time to show 'em why you're called Two-Hands!

Heh...

Secure the building! I heard voices. And there's nothing I hate more than survivors.

What a great line.

Got 'em for you, Dutch!

Don't come back here, Revy! You're a pain in the ass! How many times have you destroyed my bar?! You owe me for all this damage, you understand?! Or else I'm gonna weld your asshole shut and make you a new one on your head!

Got it. Dutch!

She's... smiling.

Hate to break it to you, but at this rate, I'd say trading you is no longer an option.

Then what's going to happen to me?!

You aren't part of our plans to begin with. How about we just part ways here?

That's not fair! I'm gonna die here! Take me with you!

Fine then. But we can't have you slowing us down. Revy, we're leaving!

Gotcha!

Get in!

Take this, cocksuckers!

Hey Dutch, Bao was so pissed off, he looked like a steaming pot. He said unless we pay him back he's going to weld our assholes.

That's scary. I think I'm going to cry.

What the hell is this? A movie? Am I in a movie?

Don't be stupid. This is way more entertaining than Hollywood's ever gonna be.


Captain, we've got 16 dead, 8 wounded. I'm sorry, sir. We thought they were punks. We underestimated them.

Well, Shutorm, we're not dealing with some random amateurs here. In fact, they scored quite a victory against us today. In Liberia, all we had to shoot at were tired old men and little brats. Too slow and no fight left in 'em. But these guys are full of energy. I've been waiting for something like this.


If we maintain the speed we should reach Balawan Port by daybreak. We'll meet Balalaika there. So... Rock.

......?

Benny is getting in touch with your company as we speak.

(grunts) Waah! What the hell! So there is a way to get this done.

If negotiations don't go well, we're going to have to leave you in Malaya. I'm sorry. The place is crawling with low-lifes and bandits, but you should survive for a while. OK?

Are you serious?! You bring me this far just to let me die?! What is this?! After dragging me everywhere! You're the ones who brought me here! The least you could do is leave me somewhere safe!

I wouldn't push your luck. First you come crying to us then you want to use us like a taxi? I know. Why don't I do you a fucking favor and show you what color your brain is?

Wait.

Yeah, we're connected. We're using an Assault Dial so the line should be totally secure.

Rock, it's your boss, Mr. Kageyama.

Hello there, sir! Okajima speaking, I'm very sorry. Now, regarding the lost of the disk, I can't...

Right. There's no need to worry about that anymore. As far as I'm concerned, that disk no longer exists.

...I don't understand.

Given your situation, I suppose it can't hurt to tell you the truth. Keep this to yourself. It's difficult to explain, but in order to hedge against the downturn in business, our board agreed to aid in the developments of nuclear weapons for a certain war-torn country. That disk contained the plans. It's truly been nothing but trouble for management. I mean, nukes in this day and age. Really, it makes me question their judgment. Anyway, eventually I will be in a position to do something about this, but in the meantime, this cannot be made public, Okajima. For the sake of the 50,000 employees of Asahi Industries, disappear into the South China Sea. You'll be promoted up to assistant manager and I'll also request that the president and all of the other board members attend your funeral. Well then, the professional soldiers that we hired should be arriving shortly.


Is it loaded?

Fully armed, Captain. Rockets and machine guns, the more you shoot the more the invoice will be. The Japanese sure are generous.

Let's move out!


They weren't worried about ditching you. Though I guess I can sympathize. Anyway, there goes the ransom, which means I don't get a bonus. But is all of that really enough to make you throw up?

Just leave me alone...

Revy, are you up on deck?

Uh-huh.

I'm picking up something and it's coming straight at us, but it's not a boat. It's way too fast. It's at 3 hours 5 minutes. Can you see anything?

It's a gunship! At minimum altitude!

Goddamn it! An attack helicopter?!

We have a visual!

I don't need confirmation, I can smell. It's them, all right.

Damn them. That's how they're going to kill me?

Yo, Rock! Heads up!

A gun?! I don't want it! Don't make me hold this!

Although I guess it won't be much more than a comfort to ya.

He's coming. He's going to bite our ass!

This isn't good! We're in serious shit!

He's firing at us!

I'm pretty sure I know, it's not good, Dutch.

Hit it! Shoot it down!

Shut up! You think you can do any better? Dipshit! I hope you realize you're hiding under a torpedo launcher! Better make sure you don't get blown up! Huh?! You dumbass!

The hell with you guys! I'm getting the hell out of here!

You limp-dick, son of a bitch! You're running away?!

Stop it! Why do I have to suffer like this? I can't take it anymore!

Good. We'll sit back and watch 'em from up here.

But Captain, we have the opportunity to completely destroy them now.

You just don't get it, do ya? Right now I got these poor bastards exactly where I want 'em. Don't you wanna have a good long laugh while they cry, howl and piss themselves down there?

Damn it! You all seem to think you can do and say anything you want to me! Everyone, even my damn boss! Will someone tell me why the hell I have to suffer like this?!

I'm already dead. You said it, remember?


You want her to replace Iwasawa?


No way!


Huh?


The name's Yui! Nice to meet ya!


Who is she?


Weren't you listening at all?
She's the candidate for Grldemo's new vocalist.


Hey kid, Girls Dead Monster is a rock band. Aren't you confusing it with a pop group?


No! I can sing it right! Listen to me sing before you judge me!


Well, at least she's got the look down pat.

--  My Soul, Your Beats (Grldemo Version) --


Yaaay!! Everyone, thanks for coming today! Yaahoooooo!

-- Day Game Angel Beats Episode 04 --


HUH!?


Is this part of her performance?


Oh dude...


Is this death metal?!


Maybe...


I'm- I'm- Dying..


No I think that was an accident.


She's awfully bubbly.
She's the exact opposite of Iwasawa's cool beauty.


I have doubts about letting her be the lead vocalist for Girls Dead Monster.


Should we look for someone else?


Sounds good!


Hey! I sing it great! I'm a huge fan of Iwasawa... I can sing all her songs!


Sorry, but you didn't touch my heart.


Not in the least.


Nope.


Hey! Don't dash a promising starlet's hopes with such vague reviews--and you call yourselves upperclassmen!
How dare you!


She sure is noisy!


And we already have issues with her behavior.


So what now?


Uhhh at least she's motivated.


She's just a groupie.


We'll let the band members take over from here.


Seriously!?
Sweeeeeeeeeet!!
I get to team up with the guitarist, Hisako! Hisako's murderous riff is absolutely killer! She can burn the house down! And I'd help!


You'll get fired.


What!?


They'll fire you.


Did I say something wrong?! Seriously, you aren't giving me a chance here! I mean, don't you know that-- (Talks while Yuri is talking)


(sigh) We can't hold any big operations during the ball tournament with the band like this.


A ball tournament? So we actually hold one?


Of course we do. This is a normal high school.


Are we going to sit and watch?


Naturally, we'll be participating.


But wait! Won't we get obliterated?


It’ll be guerrilla warfare, of course. Alright, now listen up you guys! First step I want you to do is I want you to gather up some members and make your own teams--lose to the normal students and it's a penalty death game.


What!?


Why don't people pay attention to me!? I don't know what-- (Talks while they're talking)


She's pissed off that we fail at everything, isn't she?


It's our job to train every day. She's checking the results. Otonashi, I really need you, man.


Sure you're not gay?


Noo! I-I need you for the team!
Let's team up, Otonashi! We're doomed if we lose. Yurippe is serious!


Do you have anyone else in mind for the team?


Haha, just leave it to me!
I’ve survived off my popularity.
We’ll make a kick-butt team.

Huuuh? So you’re on Takamatsu’s team?


Yep!


Oh man! I don’t get it! Why didn’t you wait for me?!


Waiting for your invitation makes no sense whatsoever.
I had to accept his invitation.


…And here she's great at athletics.
This sucks!


So much for your popularity.


I’ve got no choice now.
It’s unfair to the others, but let’s invite Class Captain Matsushita the Fifth.


I bet he's already taken.


Don’t worry.
He’s waited for me.
You see, we're like bosom buddies.
Hehe, that’s kind of embarrassing.


About that, I’m already on Takeyama’s team.


Why?!


I didn't have a reason to turn him down.


Woah Woah hold on just a darn minute! Why'd you do it?! I believed in you so much man!


Well he said he'd give me all the beef udon tickets he gets from now on.


...Meat?


Earlier he said "We're like bosom buddies," quickly followed by "That's kinda embarrassing."


Noo! don't tell him that!

Dammit. Alright then, next up is TK. C'mon TK don't let me down.


Come to think of it, why does everyone call him TK anyway?


He calls himself TK. No one knows why. No one knows his real name. He's shrouded in mystery, but knowing TK I have a gut feeling that he won't let me down.


God damn it!


So much for TK’s loyalty to you.
So, what type of ball game are we talking about here anyway?


It's baseball.


So, we need seven more teammates…
Isn’t that impossible?


Looks like you're in a bind.
Hinata&
Huh?


Hahaha.


My, if it isn’t the death metal girl with a killer performance!


Do I look like I’d perform like that?!


You most certainly do.
So? What do you want anyway?


You need more teammates, right?
I'd be a big asset?


An asset?
No, wait, if a ball hit you dead in the face, the pitcher would get disqualified.
You’re a big hitter!
Perfect! You’re in!


You sure your brain didn't melt and ooze outta your nose?!


Are you little! I'm your upperclassman!


Excuse me, what I meant to ask "Did your brain melt and slip out through your nose?"


Hell no!


Sir, that hurt!


Quit complaining! I’m hurtin’ too!


But it looks like she has good reflexes than me.


Otonashi, what’s gotten into you?!
I don’t want people to think we’re friends with this screwball.


That hurt…


I hate to break it to you, but we aren't getting anyone you had your heart set on.


Yeah, yeah, I saw the while thing.
That’s why I’ve come to offer my help, mew.


I dare you to say that again.


My help, mew!


God, don't do that voice. It's so obnoxious.


Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!


Could we please get going?


Shiina, where are you? C'mon out! Shiina! Huh?!


What is it?


I was looking for you.
You've got great reflexes, right?


I wouldn't know about all that.


I know you'd be great for the team.
It's baseball! Let's play baseball!!


Ever since that day... I keep running it over and over in my head how I coulda lost to that newbie.


Are you talking about Operation Parachute to the Guild?
Otonashi's become a legend because he was the only survivor.


Oh, c'mon. I was just lucky.


I just don't get it. I should be stronger than you in every possible way.


I bet.


But if I was inferior to you in any way, it would be in concentration.


Nah, I think you have way better concentration than me.


Ever since that day... I've been balancing this stupid bloom on the tip of my finger.


She's a morn.


Yeah, but she's a powerful moron.


It's perfect timing. Let's fight, kid.


How can we fight when you're holding a broom?


Through baseball, of course!
Just see who gets voted most valuable player or something.
But you guys just can't fight one-on-one!


Humph. Very well, then.


I don't have to balance a broom, do I?


Of course not, this will make the gap in our concentration levels obvious.


Okay, then it's settled!


It means we're recruiting nothing but morons!


We're up to four players.


No, darn, I guess we're gonna have invite him any way.

No one will invite him to their team.
He's impulsive and only obeys orders from Yurippe.


Bluntly put, he's another moron.


But you can use morons!
And look, no one compares with him when it comes to swinging around sticks.


Humpf, so you've finally come.
It's time to finish our fight!


Yeah,yeah, yeah, but first preliminary.
We need to see which of you has superior athletic ability at the ball game.


Oh yeah.


Strength alone isn't enough to grab Yurippe's attention.


Humpf, very well.


Moron! He doesn't even realize he's being used.

Battlefront 
Sorry.


All the Battlefront members have been recruited by other teams.


There's just five of us. What now?


OK. Aren't you ever going to put down that broom?
It makes everything you say sound like a joke.


I'll put it down when my concentration finally breaks.


Then, how about this?!
What?!


What are you doing?


Come on. You two don't start that.
Hinata, can you please stop...
Hinata?
Hinata! What's wrong?


Oh. Oh. It's nothing really.
I was just kinda spacing out for a minute.
So then, I guess we're out of options.
We'll have to invite some students who are halfway normal.


Hey, hey!
I'll invite some of my good friends! OK. I'll do that.


Your friends? We'll try it.


You see, all of us are...
...kinda like Yui's biggest fans.
More like her personal body guards.


I haven't let my talent get to my head and I've been holding live street performances.


They're a bunch of groupies!
How are they gonna help us get a winning baseball team?


With them, we're up to eight players at least.


Fine!
We've got plenty of people on our team now.
This was supposed to be guerilla warfare anyway.
We'll be fine if we cut out the center fielder and
have the right and left fielders cover that area.
Yes.


Uhh, I don't think that'll work.



Wow!


Homerun!


Way to go, TK!
It's total mystery what you did before you died!


Don't stop dancing!


It went flyin'!


Our guerilla operation is running smoothly.
I wonder how poor little Angel is feeling about now?


All of the Battlefront teams are winning nicely!


Well then, looks like it's time to play ball!


Not again.


Whoever beats us gets to move to the next match.
Use rock-paper-scissors to determine our opponents.


New teams keep popping up all over the place.


We're students at this school also!
We belong here too.
C'mon, Yui a little help here.


Bring it on! Hi-ya!


Don't threaten the guy like that!


You're dislocating my joints!
I won't be able to hit a homerun!


No one's expectiong you to!


We'll have to play the penalty game if we lose.
Take the first game seriously!
All right you're first dude!


Who me?


And me?


Just a sec.
I'll go second and Shiina's third.
You hear me Shiina?
That's mean you'll go fourth.
Now listen to me. You lose if you don't bring everyone home.
You got me?


All right then, that will be easy enough.


They'll call the game if we get seven runs.
Let's finish this up before Angel get here.
C'mon, let's go!
Go team!


Yeah
Yeah


I kind off think that we seriously lack team spirit.


Play ball.


We're going for a called game, eh?
As first batter, I've gotta get on a base.


He did it!


Yay!


Com'on, is that the best you've got?!


What was that?!


You're not done yet!


C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!


That's not a sport!
This is not baseball.


They are morons.


Oh, jeez.
I've had enough playing around.


Are you ready?


For what?


Bring it on!

Hey-ya!

Homerun!

Oh man!


So? Why am I the pitcher?


All right, since Noda hit a homerun,
you've gotta make a rebound by not letting the enemy team score.


Wait, so who were we playing against?


C'mon!


Strike!


C'mon you are baby?


You little!


Put some muscle into it.


Jackass!

Jerk!

Don't play by yourselves!


Even death can't cure stupid.


Four ball!


Out!


Wow, what a moron.


Team Hinata has won three called games.


Great! Out battlefront teams are winning nicely.
Everyone is desperate since they're terrified of a penalty game worse than death.
How silly.


Your penalty games are infamous in battle front
for driving people crazy and making them take on new personalities.


You're right...
What kind of game is that?!


Well, I've never played one, so...


I've never implemented one.
Oopsie.
She's finally shown herself.
We don't have any weapons, just bats and gloves.
How will she try to peacefully resolve that hitch.
I can't miss a second of this.

Your team wasn't registerd for this tournament.


So what? We've got a right to play if we want to.

I'm Vice Student Body President Naoi.
We've formed Team Student Body.
We shall defeat your teams fair-and-square.
And I'm afraid the score won't even be close.


What? But all of your players are regulars on the baseball team.
That's not fair.
There's no way we stand a chance against you.


Prepare to get your butts cleaned!


You struck out twice already!
Just keep your mouth shut.
And it's prepare to get your butts kicked.
Wiping your butt's a hygiene thing!


That hurts!


You are stupid moron.


Both Team Takeyama and Team Takamatsu have lost to called games.


Man! That's against the rules!
So, we're down to one team then..
Who is it?


It's Hinata's team.


I was trying to kick Angel's butt fair-and-square.
Jeez, everyone's so useless!


So, she's finally come.


We'll hereby start the final game.


Man, she's so not cute.
The least she could do is try provoking us.


Play ball!




Hiya!


Homerun!


Sweet!


Time out!
This stinks!
There's no way we stand a chance against regulars from a baseball team.
Our outfielders are particularly bad.


Oh, I had some extra meal tickets, so I game them to him.


You did?
Excellent! You did great!
Good job Otonashi.
I'm proud of you.
He never forget a favor when it comes to foods.
He's very loyal.
Now the outfield's great.


Uncle! Uncle!


Good job! Matsusita the 5th!


This is more like a thriling circus than a baseball team...


Out! Three outs. Change.


Great!


Change pitchers.


They'll win at this rate!
Not bad, guys!
And they're even playing fair.
Have we ever let things go smoothly for poor little Angel?
Serves her right...


Yurippe, you sound like a villain.


We can pull this off.
It's the final inning, with a one point difference.
Two outs with runners on second and third...


Time!
Crap. Look man, I really don't think I can hold them back.
You think that maybe we can change pitch-.
What's wrong, hey Hinata?


Oh, well, long ago, back when I was still alive,
I went through a similar situation.
It was a super important game.
Probably the most important game I've ever played.


Are you...
Are you actually trembling?


Really? That's weird...


What happend to you?


I don't know.
I can't really remember exactly.
I was on the baseball team.
We were headed for Koshien Nationals.
It was deathly hot.
All I could taste was the dirt in my mouth.
I remember that perfectly.
It was the last game for regionals.
We had two outs with runners on second and third.
There was a simple pop fly to second.
It was headed right for me, but...
Did I catch it or drop it?
I just can't remember.
Something so important, how could I forget?
Nah, I don't know I guess I'd remember if I caught or not.
I bet I didn't catch it after all.


I don't know what to say to him.
He threw our three years of hard work down the toilet.
He's such a jinx.
Don't blame him.
He's barely budged since then.
Do you think he'll get over it?
I'm kind of worried, I'm gonna ask our upperclassmen for advice.

Hey!
I heard the whole thing.
It really sucks.
It must be killing you.
I bet what you need right now...
...is some of this.
It's okay.
C'mon, just relax and give it a try, okay?
It will make you feel better.


Are you...
going to disappear?
You... think you'll disappear if we win the game?


Of course not!
That's just crazy. Obliterated over this?


Finish the game, Otonashi!


No way!
It's a pop fly to second.
It's just like back then.


Hinata!


Will it all be over if I catch it?
I bet it would feel great.
Yeah, it would feel amazing.


Don't catch it, Hinata!
I...
I don't want you to disappear!


You're open!
That's what you get for all those locks!


Runner in!


Why.
You little.
Out of all times, why did you have to do it except now?


I'm sorry! I'll wait for a more opportune moment next time!
Stop it! Stop it! Let me go! I mean it! You're hurting m-


No way!


Good God! That sucks!


Runner in!
Game over!


I will never forgive you for this.
I coulda caught that!
Die! Die!


Both of you, go die.


Hey, so what’s the problem baby?


Good day.

[Freddie brings Strawberry Sunday]


Well that was fast.


I figured you’d coming in same time soon.


Kind of hard to believe you’ve been waiting for me too long.


I missed you so much…


Freddie, could you come here?


Hey, hang on! Cindy!


Hash! If you keep bothering me I’ll never get any work done!


What’s your problem with me?!


To be honest, I don’t really care if a guy keeps trying to chase after me. Actually, I’m the type of girl who likes to do the chasing.


What are you talking about? So tell me what kind of guy you’re looking for then, baby?


A real he-man. I like a man wild, sexy and intelligent and still kind to women, always relaxed and he is got to be die for cute! A real head turner. Just like Dante!


Dante?!


Him!


Huh?


If you could become just a little more like Dante, I might think about going out with you!


Hey, Cindy! That guy? She thinks he is a real man? Ugh…

 5 In Private


I don’t get it… So just what the Cindy see in that guy like that in any way? Agh?!

[Dante and Isaac entered the club]


What the… oh, did I… guess I drink too much…

[Gunfire]


Ugh?!

[Dante appeared]


She is not here! She is not here! What gives? Where that woman go?!


Just do it…


Hey dude! Hey! Was that…

[Punched]


Cindy forget about that guy…


My god! What did happened to your face?!


Oou! Cindy! Listen up! Listen good! That Dante guy is no real man! He is nothing but a pervert! Forget you ever met him!


What?


I saw with my own eyes! He went right into the girl’s rest room what gives!


What are you talking about?!


Cindy! What I’m saying is he picked up some girl took her to the rest room and… Oou! Hey, what gives?!

[On the street]


Gad damn it! Damn it, I swear I’m going to get the dirt on you!


Hey! What do you think you’re doing!


Ah… n… nothing!

[Patty chase Isaac]


Huh!



Looks like business is as slow as always eh?


Yeah, yeah whatever. Let just see it.


Now take it easy. Look… here we go.


Agh!


You watch your back.


Like you give a shit…




What the hell are you doing here Dante? Get to road.


I came to give you a little message. You guys don’t need to be messing with the little thing like this now do you? Huh…


No way! He is going to take on the mafia?!

[Mafia turns into Devil]


Holy shit! He really did it! Jesus Crist! Do something with this maniac! Agh! He got to be crazy! He is out of his mind! Ugggh!

[Isaac fall into water]


Stay away from that guy! He is a heartless cold blooded killer! It doesn’t matter even it’s the mafia or whoever! That dude will even kill people for money! It wouldn’t matter if you had nine lives! If you’re with that guy, you will just get used up Cindy! Trust me! He’ll wind up little bit hall!

Customer 
He said “little bit hall”…

Customer 
Will she tell some one day?


No wait! You’re misunderstanding me! Cindy!


Just go home!


Oh… don’t be that way…



What gives? The doors aren’t even locked. This is what I should’ve done in the first place! I don’t care what it is! I just need to find something that will land this freak into slimmer!


I can make your wish come true.


Ah? It’s my imagination…


Now I’ll be able to eat up that child.


You’ll just turn that light. Please do.


You got to get me out of here!


Here! Up ahead where you are!


I lived here for practically while, boy. Let me out of here!


You mourn! Me… I’ll be the one you need…yes…


I’ll be the one who guide you. So get loss!


Hey, let me out of here…


Aaaaaagh!


Your wish will come true…

[Isaac managed to escape]


What the hell are those things?!


They are devils.


Wh… who are you?!


I don’t think you’ve got the right to ask since you’re the one who is broke into someone’s house.


I… that’s…


Just relax, friend. I won’t tell Dante about this. You want to know… the real truth about Dante, do you not?


Huh?!


If that’s the case, I’ve got something for you.


What gives? What is this?


Don’t ask. Just take it and go. When you open it, you’ll know what Dante really is.


Dante! You’re home aren’t you?! Morison told me about it. Sounds like you made a bunch of money, haven’t you?

[Lady breaks into the room]


Huh?



Hey, it’s true Cindy! You got to believe me! I promise! I swear I saw with my own eyes! That dude isn’t normal! He is crazy! There’s something really weird about him!


He is weird? You’ve broke into Dante’s place, and when Dante wasn’t even there!


That… well, that was just because… it because I want you to know that he is dangerous, baby!


Shame on you!


Ahg… why did things turn out like this… Damn it that hurt! What the… Ugh! God damn it! Trying to make me stupid?!

[Devil grooms]


Agh?! My family have been pacifist since my grandfather’s time. But not anymore!

[Isaac goes outside]


Well it’s just a little city… it’s all right. Come on. It’s not like I’m going to eat you or anything. Ugh?! Who is it?! Who is that over there?!

[Devil appears]

Devil May Cry


Aaaaagh! What the hell is that?!

[Isaac hides into gavage box]


Why there is he?! You idiot! Get out of here!


Nice time in there, you dickhead!


Agh?!


Seems that lately I have nothing to fight but a bunch of weaklings. I’ve been want to go get something that give me a little bit of work out!

[Dante kills Devil]


Huh…


Agh… a de… it’s a demon.


No barking, no bite…



It’s true! You got to believe me Cindy! Cindy!


Isaac!


Listen! I saw that dude hack a demon in two with his big sword that he carries. Listen! He is a demon! It’s true! That guy is a demon himself! A demon I tell you! That’s the only explanation for all of this!


I cannot believe you! It’s afternoon and I’d swear you’re still sleep and dreaming!


Nonsense! I didn’t dream any of this! Uuuuugh! How can I make you believe me?!

[Dante appears]


Aaaaagh!


Come in, Dante. The usual?


Aaaaagh!


Hey, settle down!


So who is that? You’re little boy friend?


Hmm… well, something about him made me actually think about maybe dating him. But he is acting like a stoking psych pass lately. May be, he kind of misunderstood the comment I made the other date. I mean the only thing that I mean t was I wish his a little more like you are Dante. It looks like he took what I was saying totally out of context. And now he said I should stay away from you because you are a demon!


Well, he is got something about half right.


Huh? And get a wrote of this, Dante. He swears he saw you kill a demon last night. Isn’t that crazy? I mean it’s so stupid. Just that I wanted to be the one that chase him. Oh, I’m sorry. I’ll be right with you.



Yap, that’s right.


You can be a little devil, you know that?!


Who is the devil? It’ll be a lot better off giving me a money to pay off what you owe me rather than have me take it from you because you lost it pool.


Are you saying he got really that far in debt? I mean, in some weird old man has been find near office this lately too.


A wired man?


Uh-huh. But he seems like a total wispy wimp, so I get rid of him pronto!


That reminds me… there was some visitor in your office when I stopped by recently too.


A visitor?



Damn it…

[Isaac meet Dante]


Aaaaagh!

[Dante finds the bell and after Isaac]


Agh!

[Dante rings the bell]


Graaaagh!


Aaaaagh! Befind you! Look out!


Dante!


Dante!


Dante!


You call?

[Dante kills every demons]


You ready?


Ugh?!


Because it looks like now, this party’s just getting started!


N… No! Stop!

[Gigantic demon appears]


Stop! What are you doing man?! What gives?!


Alright… bring it on!

[Dante vs. Demon]


Just a minute. If you got something. If you gonna skip town, you should at least let her know about it. If you don’t, she can’t chase you here even if she wants to.


What do you mean by that?!


Why don’t you ask for yourself?


You mean… you came here just to tell me that?


I’m just a demon man, I just hadn’t have my fill of fun yet. Huh!

[Dante destroys the bell]


Dante! What are you?! I mean, who are you?!


Who knows… may be you should try asking God or something…



I’ll have what he is having!


Huh?


I said, I want one of those too!


Uh… Airght! Freddie! One Strawberry Sunday!


Huh? So what are you planning eat with me?


There you go.


Okay, one Strawberry Sunday with extra berry. Enjoy!


Hagh… it kind of making me loose my appetite dude…

I’m not sure when it started. But before I know, I was always listening to her songs. Tougher than any man, Softer than any woman. She sings the sadness in human arts. If I get to meet her, I’ll probably thank her. Because she made me realized that even I have enough emotional depth to understand songs. Keep on playing. Next mission, “Lock Queen”.

I'm Mikado Ryugamine.

Wow, Masaomi! No way!


There aren't too many color gangs any more.
But they clashed with the gangs in Saitama. Most of 'em got busted.


Anri Sonohara. It's nice to meet you.

Mika!
I'm so sorry!


You wanted to be a real Ikebukurian. Then accept your challenge.


There you are. I've found you.
My love...



I'm sorry... Really I am!
I'll tell you what. I'll give it back! Just let me go!


This is bad. Really bad...


Oh... It's my fault, Celty.
It wasn't even that great of a job, I don't know why I took it.


The job itself should've been pretty easy.
But then, from outta nowhere, that thing showed up.

Celty's 
Inhuman! Monster! Monster! Monster!


You heard a voice come form your wound?


It said that I was a monster.


Well now, that's just rude! I prefer enchantress personally.


What was it?
What if it was some kinda alien?


Celty... Was that supposed to be a joke?


M-Monster!


Let's go!
Sometimes, it seems this city is only made up of pranks, impulses, and chance.



And this could just be another one of God's pranks or impulses.
Here I am, walking home next to a chick that easily tops my list of the 37 girls I fell in love with on the first day of school.
She's a first-rate hottie with glasses. And then, this dork shows up. Totally blows...


You took some guff the other day.


Oh, yeah.


Uh...


This so isn't working.
I sure didn't see that coming. You putting the moves on her before me.


That isn't what I was doing!


What the... Mikado!

But, you know, it's all good.
I think if I were you, though, I would have taken that shot and scored.
By now, I'd be whispering sweet nothings to her in West Gate Park.
Don't get shocked and go out with me!


Hey! What are you...


Um, I'm not...


It's all right. You don't need to answer right away.
I've got the same offer out to 7 other girls and I still don't know which one I want most.


Don't waste your time trying to make sense of this guy, Anri. It'll just make your head hurt.
I know he likes to act like a playboy, but he's far from it. Last time he hit on girls...


Okay, you've said enough!
This guy is Mikado Ryugamine, my best friend.
He comes from the sticks and has just been in Ikebukuro a few days.
He's pretty naive, but also really stubborn. So, I can never leave him alone.
And it seems this noob and I have ended up in a bit of love triangle. I guess that's part of being young.


I can tell you're good friends.


Yeah, best friends.


It's the cross I bear.


As for how we ended up in this mess, well, that goes back to the first day of school.



Seiji Yagiri. It's nice to meet all of you.


Thank you, Seiji. That'll be enough.
Please take your seat and we'll move on.


No, sir.
Listen, I just wanna say I won't be at school for a while.
Well, actually, I'll never be back.
I have my reasons. This is something very important to me.
I gotta go. I can't waste any more time with you people.
Good bye, sir.


Seiji, wait. Please just hold on a second.
Seiji, wait.


When Mikado told me that story, my first thought was, "Wow, it takes all kinds to make this world."


Please! Wait!


And that was the moment I fell in love!
Cute little smile, bitchen boobs. I guess she wasn't smiling, whatever.


I said I don't know anything!


Wait, hold on!


Hello. Hey, you good down there?

Well, that's the short of how she found herself at the very top of my potential-girlfriend list.
And then...



Hey, Anri. You heading home now?


Yeah.


Everything okay, Anri?
If something is bothering you, you can tell me. I'm concerned.
If there's a bully or you're in trouble, let me know.


I'm fine.


You sure there isn't something you wanna talk about?


No, I'm fine.


Okay. You know, I haven't seen Harima come to school yet.
Even though you're both in the same class now...
I want you to know, it wasn't easy making that happen.
I talked to Mr. Saito from your junior high, he told me to make sure that I'd take extra special care of you.
So you can tell me anything you want, okay?
I know. Why don't I take you home today?
Did you hear? The Slasher was in Ikebukuro again.


Mr. Nasujima, you sexually harassing her?
Wow, you sure were getting pretty handy there with our class rep, teach.
I mean, if that wasn't sexual harassment, then I sure don't know what is.
So, you like the sexy horosho types.


Kida! Enough with the clowning!
Anri, I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea and start spreading rumors.


Does she really seem like the gossipy type to you?


No, you got a point. You kids take care.


And you have nothing to worry about. The only one spreading rumors will be me.
Totally heroic, right? Can you get more awesome than me? How can she not be in love right now?


Masaomi? Anri?


Of course this is when you would show up.



Here you go. All yours.


Thank you.


Hey, seriously, watch out for that guy.
He's bad news. Most of it is just rumors, but Nasujima really did go after a student once.


He did what?


Yeah, an older student named Haruna Niekawa. She transferred out second semester of last year.
Word about them dating spread quickly, then they broke things off so he wouldn't get busted.


Really?


Maybe Nasujima or the school made her leave, or she left on her own. Either way, she's not here this year.
Hey, if he messes with you, Mikado and I will take him out. Won't we, buddy?


Uh, yeah.
I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do, but if you need my help, I'm glad to do it.


Dude! Wrong line!
You're supposed to be all, "I don't know what I'm doing, but love is the wind beneath my wings."
Or something like that. Otherwise you're a puss.


Hey, have some manners.


It's just the truth.


Anyway, about those girls...


Huh?


The ones that were bullying you. They're from your junior high, right?


How... How did you know that?


Well, it was just some of the things they said to you.
It seemed like there might have been some other girl around who used to stick up for you.
But I guess that girl's gone now and so those girls came back to harass you again.


Yeah, that's right.
A friend of yours has disappeared. Still no sign of her yet?


It's Mika Harima from our class, right?


They're saying that she's just absent from school right now.
But she's been missing since before school even started.


Shouldn't we tell the cops about this?


The last I heard from her she had sent a text to me and her family.
She said her heart was broken, so she was taking a quick trip and not to worry.


Her heart was broken? What happened?


Well, she...
Listen, this might come as a bit of a shock to you.


After all I've seen these past few days, I doubt anything can shock me.


My friend, Mika, is a stalker...


Gotcha. So that guy we overheard you talking to earlier...
Mika was stalking him...
No, sorry. She was deeply in love with him and had to go on a trip because he rejected her.


Mm-hmm.


That's an issue for her family, then. Not you.
If she doesn't come back soon, they'll call the cops.


Were the two of you close? Were you good friends?


Why is he asking her that?


Well, we were together all the time.


Whoa, his intuition is oddly good.


I'm not naturally very social, but she dragged me along wherever she went.
And it was only because of her I actually met people.
Then when I found out she chose the same high school I did, I actually felt kinda guilty about it.


So, then...


Mikado, I know what you're thinking.
That Mika only kept Anri around to make herself look better.
But dude, don't say that.


I know.


Know what?


That Mika was only using me to make herself look better. But to be completely honest, I was using her, too.
Depending on her made my life easier, pretty soon, I couldn't imagine living any other way.


Um...


But now, I think I'm okay. I've realized that I don't really need her.
I'm used to it now. I'm doing fine without her.
To tell you guys the truth, I only asked to be class rep because that's the job she wanted.
I figured I should just do it in her place.
I wanted to prove to myself that I can be better than she is.
You think I'm devious, don't you?


Actually, I think it's devious that you're telling us this.
It kinda seems like you're asking for a forgiveness or something.
The fact that you wanted to be better than her is not something you should feel the need to defend.
If you ask me, that's something you should really own and be proud of.
Uh... But...


You're so right. Thank you, Mikado.


I've gotta say, I do dig this side of him.


Masaomi!


You're lame!


Why am I lame?



What? The toughest guy in Ikebukuro?


Yeah, who is it?


You with some magazine?
Toughest, how lame are you.


You know who I think is the most scary?
That guy on the black bike.


I know him. He's like got no head.


No way!


But, then again, there's that Slasher.


Oh, right.


Yeah. Wouldn't you guys see the Dollars are pretty hardcore right now?


The Dollars?


Yeah, the Dollars!



Thanks for everything today.
I should really be getting home.


All right. See ya.


Goodbye, my dear Anri.


You know, I started thinking of that Seiji and her friend, Mika, might actually be together right now.


The stalker got the stalkee?


I don't know, I'm not sure. Maybe she kidnapped him or something.


More likely.


If we wanted to, how could we find her?


I say drop it. Anri said she's fine.


You would need a massive organization for something like this.
Like the Dollars.


Mikado, don't tell me you're seriously thinking about joining the Dollars.


No, no way.


You don't want that.
Color gangs are the kinda thing that you do when you're young.
And then just regret it when you're older.


Yeah, but you've gotta do certain things when you're young.

Yellow Scarves 
Dude, I'm totally spent right now.


I had some serious depression going on before Mikado came to Ikebukuro.
I am who I am now only because a lot of people helped me out.
And one of them was definitely Mikado.
He's just kinda dropped in to Ikebukuro. And I can tell this city's too much for him.
He looks so vulnerable here, and it worries me.
I could cool him down by taking him to places a little more actual.
But I see that look in his eyes and I know he digs it here.
So instead, I just try to stick with him as much as possible.
If I had my way, he'd never have to see the darkness that lurks in this place.
And neither would I...
Bang.
I promised myself that I would never go there again.



Was that a troll just now?


More like an alien.

Taro 
Maybe they were laughing.


Sounded pretty scary.

Taro 
But then, what's with the haha?


No, I mean, aliens are scary. Not the other guy.



TsumiUta?
You know, that kanji could read Zaika.


As in wealth?


I'll take a look at it later. In the meantime, you got a job.
It's from Mr. Shiki with the Awakusu. So it's not entirely on the level. Do you still want it?


More transporting?


Yup. Exactly.
But you've gotta get this object back before you deliver it.
Now I didn't ask him what it was. I'm guessing it's best for both parties if I don't know.


I gotcha.


Great. Then about the goods, seems the guy who has it keeps moving.
We've got good info on where he likes to lay low. So finding him shouldn't be an issue, okay?


Got it.


There've been a lot more spottings of the Slasher lately. Be careful out there.



Slasher?


Uh-huh. That's what I said. That Slasher is...


They say it comes outta nowhere and beat you to a pulp.


Dude, how tough can it be if that lets you live?
The fiercest guy around here is gotta be...


Simon, from Russia Sushi.


Yeah, or maybe that intel broker who moved to Shinjuku.


Izaya Orihara.


Oh no, it's gotta be that other cat...


Shizuo Heiwajima!


What's the most bad-ass color gang right now?
The Dollars, dude.


They don't even have a color.
Up until last year, though, it was those yellow bastards.


Yellow?


Yeah, they call themselves the Yellow Scarves.


They went full tilt with a gang called the Blue Squares.
It was so naughty it wiped out both gangs.


Nah, word is now, the Yellow Scarves are back.



Come on! You come order more, you eat more!
We got engawa and scallops today.


Doesn't it seem like we've been seeing 'em a lot lately?


Seeing what?


Hmm.
Those yellow guys, right? I've seen 'em, too.


Wait a minute, you mean...

Erika, 
The Yellow Dwarves!


The Yellow Scarves.


Yeah, that's it! That one was Hermes.


Nah, those guys got their asses handed to them by the Blue Squares and then dissolved.


That's right. Then their boss backed off from the gang thing and retired or something.


Welcome, friend!


I was hoping you could tell me about the Dollars.


What?


I'm trying to keep a friend of mine from getting mixed up with them.


Why are you asking us?


Well, you're the only one I can talk to.


Guess you can't really ask Izaya Orihara about it, huh?


Look, they're kind of a mystery. We don't know a whole lot about them, either.
But since you're here, I'll tell you what we do know...



Sometimes, I feel like this town will swallow me whole.
But I'll never let that darkness find Mikado.

Mikado?
Sorry.

Yellow Scarves member 
Oh, it's gonna take more than that.

Yellow Scarves member 
In case you haven't noticed, dork, you just bumped into the Yellow Scarves.


Seiji!
Who's she? That's not Mika Harima...


I've no idea who you are.
And we're on a romantic getaway. So leave.


A romantic getaway?


Let's go.


If that's not Mika, who is it?
Masaomi?


Interesting. You say you're with the Yellow Scarves?

Yellow Scarves member 
You don't joke about that.


I said it because I doubt it.

Yellow Scarves member 
You little...


M-Masaomi!


Mikado... Why you gotta show up now?


M-Monster!


Let's go!

Man, you had me so worried.


You had me worried, too.


I guess truth be told, I'm the one who'd become dependent upon him.
Since Mikado came here, my false sense of bravado is turning into something real.
Maybe, next time, I'll be able to see her without turning and running away.


Yes.


I wasn't sure I could ever feel like this.


Wow, I didn't think you'd come here again.
Hi, Izaya.


Hello.
So, how is he?


Well, he does come by here sometimes.
But that's as far as he goes.


I'm back.
Haruna, have you eaten yet? Haruna?



So, I banned that troll who was bothering us.


Things should go back to normal.

Taro 
I hope so.


Have you heard the latest about the Yellow Scarves?
They got hit by the Slasher yesterday.

Taro 
What are the Yellow Scarves?


I wonder if the Slasher is part of the Dollars.

Taro 
They can't be!


There might be a war brewing.



It may not look like it at first, but everything that happens in this town is somehow related.
It's all part of some larger, awful truth that's beyond our comprehension.
However...
Good morning!


Hey, Anri. Good morning.


Good morning.


I may be slow to realize this, but I'm okay with this little triangle we got going on.
You know, even if things take a turn for the worse and the dots connect in ways I can't foresee, I believe this relationship won't change.
Bet we can weather whatever storm lies ahead.



The Dollars? I can't say much about them.
However, I can tell you about what is now the legendary Kazutawno incident.
Next  Active Interest.
That is as long as you don't call me Dotachin.

 The first branch of the National Central Library where Marcoh had hidden his notes regarding the philosopher stone was lost to fire. Aided by former librarian Sheska, the brothers were able to obtain a copy of the doctor's research. But inside the notes, they found something truly terrible.

 The main ingredient for a philosopher stone is human lives.

 In search of the truth hidden within the truth, of which Marcoh had spoken, Ed and Al sneaked in to the supposedly abandoned Fifth Laboratory.
.....
66 You move pretty well for your size. If you didn't though, it wouldn't be worth the effort to cut you down.

 Who are you?

66 I'm number 66. Well, that's the name they gave me when I came to work here anyway. I'm going to cut you up nice and neat. All you have to do is sit back and scream!
....
 What is all this? I bet this is what they used to transmute a philosopher stone.

48 Yes, that's correct. I don't know who you are, kid, but you sure figured out a lot just from looking at a transmutation circle.

 I'm just good like that. Who are you, pal?

48 The one in charge of guarding this place from curious brats. For the moment, let's just say my name is number 48. And believe me, I'm not your pal.My orders are to dispose of anyone who wanders in here, poking his nose where it doesn't belong. Try not to take it personally, boy.

 Alright, I won't. And you try not to take it personally when this 'boy' kicks your ass!

48 You're an alchemist, are you? Alright, then. Let's see what you got.
....
48 Prosthetic arm, huh? No matter. My sword can pierce steel as well as flesh!
.....
 My, my! What's this? I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you're hollow inside.

48 You're a perceptive one.

 I can tell from the sound. I spar against someone like you all the time.

48 So there are people like me on the outside too, are there? That's surprising.

 Yeah, it make me sick. To think there's more than one idiot in the world who came up with the brilliant idea of bonding a disembodied soul to a suit of armor.

48 Hmm. Perhaps I should introduce myself again. 48 was the number I was assigned when I was on death row. Back when I still have a living body, I was better know as 'Slicer'. I was a mass murderer, you see.

 So you were slated for execution. Tell me something then. This laboratory, are they using condemned prisoners like you to make Philosopher Stones here?

48 That, I can't tell you. It isn't my 'area'. They simply recognized my skills, gave me this body and made me a trusting guard dog.

 Interesting. I'm sure they give you a seal too, to serve as a medium between soul and armor?

48 Yes. I have a blood seal. This is it right here. If you destroy this, the fight's yours.

 That's awfully considerate of you to show me your weak spot.

48 I like to give myself a little extra challenge during a fight now and then.

 As long as you are in such a giving mood, how about this? Why not just let me go?\

48 Nice try, kid. But what kind of mass murderer let his prey get away so easily? Now, let's fight!
....
 Did you hear what I say? My dear little Elicia is about to turn 3!

 Lieutenant Colonel Hughes! Do you think this could wait? I'm at work.

 Oh, what a coincidence. I'm at work, too! She's the cutest little thing. You should see her.

 I'm sure she's adorable, but stop calling me to gush over your daughter, and on a military line, too!

 Not just my daughter, Colonel. I gush over my wife too.
...
 I know, I know. It's your turn now. Go ahead, Colonel. I know you're dying to gush over your very own scar-faced Ishvalan.

 We found many bodies on the site wherehe vanished. But all of them were so decomposed that it's been difficult to identify them. He hasn't been sighted anywhere in the East. So at the present, many people here think that it's most likely that's he dead.

 If that's the case, I should be able to lift the bodyguards from the Elric brothers soon.

 Is major Armstrong still in charge of the boys' protective detail?

 He was, but a couple of his men have taken over now.
....
 We've been played! I thought it was suspiciously quiet in here.

 Major Armstrong is gonna take his shirt off again and yell at us some more, isn't he?

 Those brats are going to pay. Did they even think how this make us look? Let's go, sergeant.

 Huh? Where?

 Where else do you think, Brosh? To the Fifth Laboratory.
.....
 What happened? My shoulder doesn't feel right.
.....
 I increased the percentage of chrome so it's less prone to rusting but it's not as strong. So don't try anything crazy.
....
 I have to find a way to end this quickly... or else, I'm dead.
.....
48 What a cute little monkey.

 Who are you calling little?
...
48 It's been too long since I had a prey worth hunting.
...
48 But you are tired and wounded now, you won't last much longer. Right about now, my companion should be finishing the partner you left outside.

 Is this companion of yours strong?

48 Yes he is. He isn't as strong as I am, though.
...
 In that case, I don't need to worry. You see, we've been sparring partner for a long time. And I've still never beat him.
.....
66 Damn it. Why can't you sit still for a second and let me cut you up, you big bucket of bolts!
...
 Huh?
...
 You are empty!
...
66 There's a bit of a story behind that. Would you like to hear? It's a pretty good yarn. You are probably already know it though. It all started with a man by the name of Barry.
...
66 Once upon a time, right here in Central, there was a butcher named Barry who loved his work. His favorite part was cutting up the meat into little, tiny pieces. But one day, Barry found that cutting up beef and pork wasn't enough anymore. So he took to the street and began cutting up people instead, night after night. In time, of course, Barry was caught, but not before twenty three victims had fallen prey to him anf his knife. Naturally, after terrorizing Central for so long, Barry was sent to the gallows for his wicked deeds. And the world was happily rid of another man. At least, that's what everyone out there believes. But our story isn't over yet. We haven't even reach the good part. Barry isn't actually dead, you see. He's very much alive, and charged with guarding a certain place, only without his body. Yes, that's right! He's standing right in front of your very eye. I am the infamous serial killer, Barry the Chopper!

 Sorry. I've never heard of you. I'm from a little town in the East, so...

66 Fine! But even if you don't know who I am, shouldn't you at least be a little scared? Shouldn't you be going "AAHHH", or "What happened to your body?", or something?
...
66 AAHHH! What happened to your body, freak?

 Hey! Now that's impolite.

66 Oh, I see. You were on death row too. You had me startled there.

 No way! I'm not a criminal!

66 Huh? Then what happened to you?

 It's kind of a long story. When I lost my body, my brother transmuted my soul and bonded it to this armor.

66 Your brother?
...
66 Ofcourse! Your brother!

 What's so funny about it?
...
66 Are you sure you and your brothers are related?

 Well I guess we don't look that much alike anymore.

66 No no no. That's not what I mean. Are you sure that you're not a puppet created and controlled by your so called brother?
...
66 Were you ever even a real person to begin with?

 How can you ask something like that? I was a real boy and my name was Alphonse Elric!
...
66 How can you be so sure of that?

 I have memories. I remember who I was before.

66 And who's to say those memories aren't made up?
...
 But Winry and Granny, they know me.

66 That's easy, they are in on it too.
...
66 Silly boy! You were never alive to begin with! It's as simple as that!

 Then how do you know you were really alive?

66 I was, trust me.
....
 This area is off-limit! Don't move!
....
66 There! Did you see that? There is nothing I love more than chopping live people. I can't control myself! I kill, therefore I am! As long as I know that, it's all I need to prove to myself that I've always been me.
(Descartes is weeping somewhere...)
......
48 Your brother is that good, is he? Then I have to hurry up and defeat you so I can get around to taking care of him.
...
 Go Al! Do it now!

48 What?
....
48 That was dirty!

 There's no such thing as dirty in a fight!
....
48 What's the matter? You still haven't destroy the blood seal I so kindly pointed out. You going to or not?

 There's something I need to ask you about.

48 The Philosopher Stone?

 Yes. Tell me everything you know about it.

48 Sorry. Can't.

 Hey now. Tell me. I did beat you at your own game.

48 That's where you're wrong. I'm not beaten yet.
....
 Impossible.
.....
48's  I forgot to tell you about this mass-murderer 'Slicer'.

48's  His crime were really done by a pair of brothers.

 An independent head and body? That's a dirty trick!

48's  Now, now. Weren't you the one who said there's no such thing as 'dirty' in a fight?

48's  Are you ready? Round 2 is about to begin, short-stuff!

 Don't call me short!
...
48's  I don't think so! I not going to give you time to transmute!
...
 Damn! I lost too much blood. I'm starting to feel dizzy.
...
 Not good, not good!
...
 Here's he come. I'm going to die, I'm going to die!
....
48's  DIE!
....
 You reminded me of someone I don't like. And now I've done exactly as he did.

48's  How could you, you damn brat!
...
 He's wriggling! That's freaky!

48's  Brother!

48's  As much as I hate to admit it, we lost.

 Then you're not going to tell me you are really three brothers, aren't you?

48 No, no.

48's  Come on, boy, you won. Hurry up and destroyed us.

 No. I'm not a murderer.

48's  With bodies like these, are we really even people?

 I consider you people whether you have physical bodies or not. If I didn't that would mean I didn't believe my own brother wasn't a person either.
....
66 Come on. What's the matter, little puppet?

 I told you I'm not a puppet!

66 You keep telling yourself that. But how can you know for sure? How can you be certain you were really alive! There is one way you can prove that you're not just a puppet made from scraps of armor.

 Huh?

66 You've got a blood seal too, right? Go ahead, break it yourself. If you die, you were a really a boy all along just like you want to believe.

 no. There's no way I can ever do that.

66.Oh, no? Then I guess I'll have to do it for you, won't I?
....
 I know that my brother is a human being. That means you guys are human too. I will not take the life of another person.
...
48's  Brother?

48's  My brother and I have been lying, stealing, cheating and killing together for as long as we can remember. And now that we are in these pseudo bodies, we're being treated like humans for the first time. Don't you see the irony? For that, boy, I'll give you a parting gift. I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you who made the Philosopher Stone, and ordered us to guard this place.
....
 My, that was a close call.
...
 Number 48, you should know better than to talk about things that don't concern you.

 Well, well, would you look at that. What's the Fullmetal pipsqueak doing here?

 Such a troublesome boy. How do you find out about this place?
...
48's  Brother... Brother... BROTHER!
...
 Quit your pathetic blubbering, you idiot! You were trying to kill one of our most important sacrifices. Do you understand me? You could have messed up the entire plan. What would we have done then, huh?
....
 Tell me who you people are. What plan are you talking about? What do you mean when you say important sacrifice?

 Oh, my. The pipsqueak rearing to go. I think I've made it angry.

 Don't call me pipsqueak again.

 Then what would you prefer? 'A' pipsqueak?
...
 Wow, now. There's no need to fight here. Someone might get hurt, you know.

 This is a fight that you started. So come on!
...
 Technical difficulty.
...
 Lucky me!
...
 You're fortunate that your arm is broken. If not for that, you wouldn't be getting off so easily.
...
 Listen to me well, boy, don't ever forget this. Always  we allowed you to live.
...
 We can't have him poking around this place again, it's too dangerous. It'll have to go. Blow it up.
.....
" You know Al, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for a while. But I guess I've been too afraid to say it."

 What was Ed about to tell me? He said he'd been too afraid to say it before. What could have frightened him that much?

"66 Are you sure you're not a puppet created by your so called 'brother'?. Were you even a real person to begin with?"
...
66 What's the matter little boy? You've got something in your mind?
...
 Shut up! You're wrong!

66 Just accept it. You'll feel better!
...
66 You're mine now little puppet!
...
Maria Stay right there! Or the next one will put a hole in your head.

66 This isn't going quite as I planned.
....
 Sergeant, get down now!
...
 What are you doing? Get away from there!

 But my brother is still inside the building!

 Ed's in there?

66 Hmm. I know what this means. Time to get out of here!
...
 Hey, you!

66 I'd get going if I were you.

 Hold it!
...
 Brother! Brother!

 Take cover, Al. Or you're going to get caught in it too!

 ED!
...
 There you are. I bought a little present for you.

 Brother!
...
 His life is not in danger but he's lost a lot of blood so you might want to get him to a hospital as soon as you can. Also, you really should keep a better eye on him. Stop him from taking these crazy risks. He's a precious resource.

 But who are you?
...
 Lieutenant Ross, we need to go.

 Sergeant, help me with him.

 What happened to him?

 We'll talk later. 
...
 And you should go too! What? He's gone.
.....
Prison  All be quiet. Calm down now.
....
 What a lovely sound. I know it well. It's the sound of a building exploding. Close as it is, I'd say it's coming from next door. The Fifth Laboratory. Ah, it's such a comforting sound. The way it reverberate through your entire body!

Prison  You keep it down in there, Kimblee.

 Oh, do excuse me. I was just recalling the Ishvalan War of Extermination. And it put me in such a good mood.
.....
"66 Are you sure you're not a puppet created by your so called 'brother'?"
.......

Don't come crying to me when you change your mind too late about dating that girl.


Can we please just drop it now?


See ya.


Later.


Hey, where's your bike?


Something happened to it.


Get on, I'll double ya.


You'll take me home? Sweet!



You honestly think Kousuke wasn't interested?


Probably. The guy usually means what he says.


I'm kinda glad actually.


Why's that?


If he gets a girlfriend, he'll treat her special, I bet.


Yeah, that'd be him alright.


Then we couldn't play baseball any more.


Yeah, you got a point.
Playing catch doesn't exactly count as baseball.


It's just..., I don't know.
I kind of felt that somehow the three of us would always be together.
Kousuke would tell us off for being late. (tell  叱る)
You'd ride me for not being able to catch the ball. (からかう)


Makoto?


Hm?


What do you say? Wanna go out?


Stop! Stop for a second!　What was that?


U, um..


Why'd you say that?


Well. I …


Where's that coming from suddenly?


You were wondering what it would be like if Kousuke got a girl friend?
I mean.. I'm not ugly, am I?


You serious?


Dead.


Oh, hang on! Wait a minute, will ya?


What is it this time? Can we just go?　Huh? Er, Makoto?



Um, what the hell are you doing down there?


Nothing at all!


Don't come crying to me when you change your mind too late about dating that girl.


Can we please just drop it now?


See ya.


Later.


Hey, where's your bike?
Get on, I'll double ya.



That loser, Kousuke beat me to it.


It's not as if he decided to go out with her.


That's what he says now but I bet if he got a girlfriend, he'd always pick her over us.


You can't be sure about that.


Oh, man, without Kousuke, we'd only be able to toss the ball around.


Why don't you give the poor guy some credit and deal with it if and when Kousuke does start seeing the girl?


Well, there's not much we can do if it happens.
Anyway, how about you go out with me?


Like I said why are we talking about this?



That's what he says now but I bet if he got a girlfriend, he'd always pick her over us.


Hey, did I ever tell you what a total idiot my little sister is?


Uh, I was talking about Kousuke, in case you didn't notice.


Forget him! Let's talk about my sister.


So anyway if Kousuke finds a girlfriend..


Let me tell you about my sister!


You want to go out with me!?



Don't come crying to me when you change your mind too late about dating that girl.


Can we please just drop it now?


Uh, Makoto, I'll take you home.


No thanks.


Yo! What's the matter?


What's her problem?


That's all your fault!


Oh! I didn't do anything!



I thought that you liked Chiaki.
Didn't you feel obligated to stick with him to help keep him in line?


I might have said something like that before.


What's the point of pretending he never asked?
Why not go out with him?


No way! Not happening!


How come?


I can't picture Chiaki and I being anything more than friends.
That's how come.


If it doesn't work out, go back to the way things were.
You're mature enough to handle that.


Thanks, but no thanks.


Sometimes these things start off one-sided and the person grows on you.
(grow  関心が次第に大きくなってくる)


It won't happen! Never!


I see. So you're gonna act like it never happened.
I feel sorry for Chiaki.
After he worked up the courage, oh, then again I suppose he wouldn't even know that he did.


9. Incident during Recess


Hey, er, you know how Chiaki transferred to our school this spring?
I heard he'd been bouncing around from school to school before that.


Apparently.


You think the rumors about him moving overseas are true?


I doubt it. He sucks at languages.


No, huh?


No chance.


I wonder if something happened to him at his last school.


Why don't you ask him?


I don't even have his email address.


So? He's in our class.


Yeah, I know, but you're such good friends with him.


I wouldn't ask him something like that.
Besides I wouldn't say we're that close.


Liar!


I'm not! I mean...


Ughhh! Ohoo!


Yeah! It's revenge, man!


Stop!


Oh, yeah! You're a loser, man!


They're getting revenge!


Leave him alone!


How about a nice shower, you stink!
Look at a little xxx xxxing dumb!
(Native  I can’t hear this.)


Hey, who shut it off?　It's Mamiya.


You about done?
(Native  Informal speech. "are" is unnecessary.)


Not over, Takase!
Later, loser!


That's pretty bad.
You're totally soaked.


Are you all right, Takase?


They threw a cola on me yesterday.
Although I did manage to throw a latte back at them.


You know, you're only making it worse, doing that, right?


Hey, Makoto! Did you watch the night game last night?
That Saito sure put the squeeze on, huh?
Why'd you look away from me?


I didn't look away.


What are you up to?


Nothing!


What's going on? Something juicy?
Come on! Tell me.


I told you it's nothing!


Huh.., What's the matter?


Konno, you jerk!


Huh?


Why did you ask me to fry that tempura in the home ec. class the other day!
(home ec. class = home economics class)


Um, well, I never thought something like that would happen.


This is all your fault, idiot!


Who are you calling an idiot?
Keep it up and I'll throw this!


No! Don't, Chiaki!


Yeah! I dare you! Oh!
(I dare できるんならやってみろ）


Ooh, I didn't mean to do that.


Stupid!


That guy's pretty rude, going around calling everyone names.
(call ~  ~の悪口をいう)


So? You're always calling me an idiot.
(Native  So? = だから何？)



Yeah, but I say it out of love.
Come on! Where's your comeback?
You're leaving me in the cold here.
She's acting weird, don't you think, Hayakawa?


Oh, uh, yes indeed.


Why the stiff talks?


Sorry, it's just that I haven't spoken to you much before.



Makoto!


She's not here!


But she always meets us here.


Did something happen?


Huh? No, no nothing at all!


You must have said something that pissed her off.
You better not have said she has big feet.
You know, she's self-conscious.


I didn't say anything! I didn't!
I don't think I did.


Toss it back!


I can't throw good when I'm thinking.
It's no use. I just don't get it.
10. What's Going On?


Oh, it's Yuri.
"Something really great happened today"
I wonder what?


Hello. Oh, hi, yeah. Hang on.
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.


I wonder what her news was?



Hurry up. Let's go, before they sell out!

Actually I'm not feeling all that well today.


Wanna go to the nurse's office?


Oh, um, no thanks. I'll be fine.


Come on. Hurry! This is gonna be good!
Come on, come on, man!
That's over here! This way, this way!


Knock it off, Takase!


Why should I listen to you!
You didn't stop when I asked you to!


All right, I admit, we were wrong, OK?!


Then you shouldn't have done it to me, [you silly ass!]
(Native  I can't understand the end.)


Jeez, that guy's lost it.
Anyone call a teacher?
(Native  Informal speech. "Did anyone call a teacher?" would be more formal.)
Come and see this!


Put it down, Takase! Takase!


Konno! Did you just give me an order!?


No, it wasn't like that.


Yes, you did!
Why? Damn it! Why it won't work!


Don't do it, Takase!


Takase!


Chiaki..., Chiaki!


Are you okay? Yuri!
That hit her big time.
What grade is she in?
Someone, call a teacher!


It wasn't my fault! It wasn't! I swear!



Now, don't cry. It's not that bad.


What if it leaves a scar?


If it does, I'll deal with it somehow.


How are you gonna do that?


I'll handle it, okay?


No boy's in here please.


Does it hurt?


Yeah.


Let's see.


No!


Come on.


Thanks.



I'm sorry, seriously.


Um, but why?


I said I'm sorry, really!


Oh, give me a break.
I mean who takes a girl to a night game on their first date?


Yeah, I thought you said that the three of us were going together.
I was looking forward to it!


How many times do I have to say sorry?
Hayakawa said a night game would work for her.


You're gonna date her?


You know it.


Ooh!


Oh, you all right?
(Native  Informal speech. "are" is unnecessary.)


You serious?


Yeah, something wrong with that?
What can I say? Yuri gets me.
You know what I mean?


How nice for you.


Jeez, you idiot, stubborn [and xxx / aiming first]!
(Native  I can't hear.)


I'm home.
Huh? Where's the rice?


I'm making some more.


Why?


Makoto ate the whole batch herself.



What's wrong with him?
First he said he liked me, now he’s going out with her?

I almost drowned!
Huh? What is this thing? Ninety



11. Guidance Counseling


Hey, Makoto!


Ah, let me go!


I think we lost this one.


She's putting us to shame. That's for sure.


The world is full of deceit.


Aww!



Sucks not having Chiaki here.
Let's make sure we get him here tomorrow.


That wouldn't be fair to Yuri.


How about I say that you miss him.
Bet he'd come then.


Who said I miss him?


Oh, please.
He only went with Hayakawa, 'cause you turned him down.


What? I did not!


Really?


What's that supposed to mean?


Oh, brother!


So what's the deal with you? Why don’t you find a girl?


'Cause if I did start going out with someone, then you'd end up alone.


Huh?



I thought you had a thingfor Kousuke.
He’s the one who always helps when you are having problems, right?


Kousuke's there for everyone.


Why don’t you go out with him?


Why would you even suggest that?


Like I said before if it doesn’t work out, you can always go back to how it was.


No way. I would never do it.


Why is that?


`Cause it'd be like toying with a person's feelings.


And you couldn't possibly do such a terrible thing?
Since you started going back into the past, you haven't exactly shown restraint.
You've played all sorts of mind games with people.


What!? Is that how you see it?


More or less.


She's a witch. I knew it. She really is my Auntie Witch.



Hey, this painting!


Do you recognize it?


Yeah, I do.
It's the one you've been restoring for so long.


It's a strange painting. The longer you look at it, the more relaxed and comforted you feel.


Huh?


I don’t know who the painter is and I still don’t really know whether it's a worthy piece of art, but there is one thing I did learn while working on its restoration.
This piece was painted during a historical period of famine and war many centuries ago.


Oh?


I wonder how someone was able to create such a beautiful painting when it must have seemed that the world was coming to an end.


Mr. 
What are you gonna do Kono? You're the only one who hasn't chosen your academic major.　Konno, Konno, Konno!


Yes!

Mr. 
Don't get all cocky on me just 'cause you got a good mark on the math quiz.


I won't.
12. Volunteer Club


Uh, that's so weird. I swear it said ninety last time I saw it.
Huh?


Why don't we ask her ourselves?


I don't know.


Ask what?


Wait! Hang on a second!


Whoa! What's this about?


Makoto Konno, we are members of the Volunteer Club and we have...


And there's something we'd like to ask you!


Never mind. It's nothing.


We have noticed something about you lately.


You're always with Kousuke.


Forget it. Let's go. Stop! Please.


Uh-huh.


So are you two going steady then? 　Or are you going out with him?


Are you going out with Kouske?

Moriko & 
Are you going out with him?



I was still in junior high at the time.
But apparently some students from the volunteer club at Kuranose senior high had gone to visit the retirement home where my grandmother lived.
Grandma was especially impressed with one of the students and she spoke to me about him many times.
She would go on and on about what a kind and gentle boy he was.
She said it over and over.
This might sound strange but she talked so much about him that I began to kind of fall in love, even though I'd never met him.


That's a sweet story.


I found out when I got into senior high that that student's name was Kousuke Tsuda.


Wow, things like that really do happen!


The problem is that Kaho's shy. She's afraid of her own shadow.


We've been working to drum up her courage.


And finally, finally we got her to tell Kousuke she's got a crush on him.


Oh, you mean the other day?


But according to Kousuke...


Um, huh?


"I've already given my heart to someone."


"I'm sorry but I cannot go out with you."


No, wait! Um...


That's not really how it went.


"How could a bonehead like that get a higher mark than I did?"


"I've gotta stop slacking off so much, sorry."
（ slack off：なまける）


So he apologized and turned me down.


Who's that bonehead he was talking about?
Is it me?


And that's when Kousuke told us.


He said that he wasn't going out with you but I'm not sure we believe him.


So how about explaining what's going on then.


Something doesn't seem right, if you ask me.

Moriko & 

Time you gave us an explanation!


Hang on a minute! Okay, you made your point already.
Ahem! I'll deal with this somehow.

Moriko & 
Deal with this?!


What do you mean, somehow?


Just trust me!



Umm, hi. Um...


Kaho!


Um, I..


Kousuke!


Uh-huh. Wo! Where'd you come from?
Didn't you just head off to the baseball field a second ago?


Never mind that!
This girl here was saying that her grandmother was so grateful about you coming around and taking care of her at her retirement home.
I'm impressed, Kousuke. So anyway...


Aaa, how do you know all that stuff about my grandmother?


Who? Me?
I met her at the bowling alley.


But my grandmother's bedridden.


Oh, um, my mistake.


Let me know when you're done gabbing.
(Native  Not "gabbling" but "gabbing." )


Ah, no! Hang on, Kousuke!


 
One more time!


Um.., well..

Kousuke!


Uh-huh.


Hold on.


Wow! Where did you come from?
Didn't you just head off to the...


Hold it!
You're being such a coward.
What's the point of getting all sulky just 'cause I got a better mark!
This has nothing to do with that!


What's your problem? Showing up, bragging your head off.
(one's head off：過度に、非常に)

And what has nothing to do with what?


I'm saying that the test scores and the fact that Kaho's in love with you have nothing to do with each other.


Ahaa, it's not true! It's not true!


Wait! Kaho!


Well, you heard what the girl said.


Ah, don't go Kousuke!



I've got to take a simpler approach to this.


What's with all the commotion? The day's just getting started.


I went back too far and I'm late again!


Makoto, the peaches. The peaches!



Huh? Unbelievable!



Now, for the headlock!
Huh? What was that?
Amazing!


Quit staring! Just carry on!
Could you move? I need the spot.



Kaho!


Huh?


I don't know exactly why, but someone wants you to come down to the courtyard.


Who does?


Tell me where we're going. What are you gonna make me do?


You'll know when we get there.


Makoto?


Later!


Okay, you got me.


You think this is what she meant by the courtyard?


Who knows?


Stand there!


What the hell is your problem? Get off!


You're hurting me.


Sorry! Can you get up?


Yeah..., ah!


I think you sprained it.


No, it's okay.


Please, there's nothing okay about it.


Kousuke, what are you doing?


Put your arm around me.


Oh, thank you.


What do you think of this new development?


This just might be the start of something.

Sekimi & 
The start of something beautiful.


All right!
Everything's good again, thanks to yours truly.
I can't remember the last time I felt so happy!

Huh? It's changed.
Ten? What's that mean?
(Native  Informal speech. "What does that mean?" would be more formal.)
Huh? Mm..

One...?
13. Borrowing the Bicycle


Not here. Maybe I got here a little too early.
Huh? There he is!

Um, excuse me. I have a question for you..., Yuri!?


You scared the life out of me! (scare the life out 　死ぬほど驚かせる)


How come you're here?


I brought the notebooks up for you.
You forgot you were on duty today, I bet.


Oh, right!


I figured as much.
I hope you appreciate our friendship here.
So, what's your question?


Oh, um, nothing forget it!


Okay.


Hey, Yuri.


Yeah?


Did you see anyone on your way up here?


Like who?


Err, never mind.


All right.


It's from Kousuke.
"She just asked me out. Jealous?"
Whatever! Who do you think set it up for you in the first place?
Oh, no!



Ma..., Ko..., To, there!
Where do you live?


On the south side, right past the station.


We should get my dad to check out your ankle.
Our clinic isn't far from here.



Come to think of it, I did actually pass someone on my way up here.
It was Chiaki.


Kousuke!


He went home.
Yeah, holding hands with that first-year girl.


It's gone.
Answer the phone!


Yeah, it's me, dad. I have, er, got a sprained ankle for you.
Think maybe you can take a look at it? No, it's not me.
Yeah, sure, we'll be right there.


Thanks for all this.


Answering 
"Please leave a message after the beep."


Damn!
What now, should I go back in time? Then again it's not like anything's happened yet.



Um, excuse me, you wouldn't know if there was a bike accident here?


Er, no, I,I don't think so,


Okay, thanks.


An accident, she said. How scary.


Huh? Kousuke!? Where are you? Kousuke!
Guame 
So, I heard that Adiane had blewn it.
She went over our heads and boasted in front of the Spiral King.
She will not come crawling back now.
Would you do me the honor of letting me strike next?

Spiral King 
Guame? You, too?

Cytomander 
What concerns me most of all, Sire, is this miniature gunmen of unknown type that they use.
You see, it's been widely reported that when it combines to become Gurren Lagann, it exhibits of host extraordinary powers it should not possess.

Spiral King 
You think you know what it is, don't you?
The humans have manage to uncover something they should'nt have.
That is all it amounts to.

Cytomander 
Whatever you think it is, it can't be brushed off so easily.
Indulge me, Sire.

Spiral King 
Guame, you dare tell me what to do?


Cytomander 
That was bold move back there.
There are few in this world who can make the Spiral King do anything.
In that one regard, you are truly superior.

Guam 
It's because that miniature Gunmen may very well turn out to be an incredible find.
And besides, he and I go back quite a long time.

Cytomander 
You're going up against a bunch of battle-hardened barbarians.
There's just no telling what they'll come up with.

Guam 
Needless to say, I have a plan.

Cytomander 
Ha.
Yes, of course.
You're just shrewd as ever.



Episode 11  Simon, Hands-Off


Nia 
Hey, everyone!


Yeah?

Nia 
What's this stuff here?


It's garbage.
It's a trash heap, obviously.

Nia 
Yes, but this belongs to Simon!
It isn't right!


Come on, he's a lost cause.
He's turned into a spineless kid who's good for nothing but digging.
He'd be better off going back to Giha Village.

Nia 
But he's...

Yoko 
Back this, there's no place here for somebody who can't pull off his own weight.
If you really want to help Simon, just don't coddle him.

Nia 
Coddle him?

Yoko 
He needs to snap himself out of this funk, or it'll never happen.


Nia 
Is this that bro person you mentioned?

Simon 
I'm crazy, aren't I?

Nia 
No, Simon.
You aren't crazy.
When he's set in stone like this, even I can see it.
I can see by all this how much you really care for this person.

Simon 
Year, well.
Digging tunnels is all I'm really good for.
Back in our villiage, everyone said I was creepy or that I smelled funny.
Bro would always hang out with me.
He was the only one who didn't make fun of me or make me feel bad.
He was tough, and kind, and he was big.
I wanted to be a man just like a Bro.
I really tried to be, but I guess, it was no use.
The trurh is I can never be like Bro.

Nia 
You are really good!

Simon 
R-Really?

Nia 
May I stay and watch for a while longer?

Simon 
Sure…

A girl in the monitor 
Ah~!
Please you have to help us!
It's awful.
Our village has been attacked by a lot of Gunmen!
Please help!
We are just defenseless girls.

There girls in the monitor 
Oh, the Gunmen are almost upon us!
Aieeee!

Kitan 
Those poor girls!
We need to help them right away.

Riron 
I guess I can find where they are.

Dayatka 
It all smells awfully fishy than me.

A guy like Pierrot 
It stinks?
It smells?

Riron 
You know, the enemy is sure to pick up that transmission, too.

Kinon 
And would people underground have a communication equipment like that?

Kitan 
Everyone, shut up!
Quit worrying about all the details!
Do you want those babes to get completely wiped out while we're standing around arguing?!
If Kamina were here, he set out to rescue them without a second thought.

Riron 
That's right.
He wouldn't hesitate for a moment.

Kitan 
Yeah, like I just said.
Right!
Dai-Gurren, move out!

Dayatka 
That's the village entrance.
They got five Gunmen.
And don't fire the main canon…

A guy like Pierrot 
Fire!

Dayatka 
No, Idiot!
There are the whole village under there.
Don't open a fire, you stupid damn ass.

Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

The enemy Gunmen are all retreating.

Yeah, sweet!
Just as I planned it!

All right, let's go see if those babes are safe!

It's nothing but hot young babes!

What a dreadful village…

Thank you! Because of you, our village has been saved from destruction!

No need to thank us. After all, the Spiral King is everyone's enemy.

Still, from what we've seen, there doesn't seem to be a single man here.
How exactly did that happen?

Well, you see, I don't know how to tell you this, but…

Stay where you are, and don't move humans!

Impossible! All this was just a Beastman trick?

I told you. It was fishy…

You bastard!

What the hell were you thinking, moron?

Sir, Dai-Gunzan has been secured.
We'll now begin searching the area for Nia and the miniature Gunmen.

Very well. And put your backs into it.

Yes, sir.

Beastmen are their enemy, so they assume all humans will be their allies.
What fools.
It looks to me like they're so stupid they don't even know who their #1 enemy is.

Quit resisting us, you little punk!

You're Princess Nia, aren't you?
General Guame says that he wants to see you right away.

Guame? Very well then, I will see him.

But first, promise not to hurt this person.

Relax, lady. We haven't been ordered to kill anyone yet.

N-Nia!

Stay put!

Don't worry about me. I will be fine. All right?

But Nia…

You know, you'll never be your Bro. I think you should always be yourself.

You're with me. Now come along.

Nia…

Damn it, let go of me, you furballs!

Humans, no manners at all.
It's Mister Furball to you.

I'm Guame, the Immovable, one of the Four Generals of the Spiral king!
And I am taking back Dai-Gunzan.
But first I'm going to execute you publicly as a warning to the others.
Stay in here until we're ready for you!

The Spiral King has issued orders to have you eliminated.

Then I guess that means what Adiane said is true?

Yes, indeed it is.
You realize that if you died in that box in the valley, it would have been [quite/quiet] painless death.
His Majesty is imbued with immortality and he's lived for a thousand years or more.
Creating and raising children is a pastime for him.
He disposes of those if he's tired of.
As he would a doll.
That's all there is to it.

Like a doll?

Now I've been told you actually asked him straight to his face "Why was I born?"
That was a bad move. His Majesty detests human self-awareness.
But who can blame him? Why would a puppet, a simple plaything need self-awareness?

So I'm just like that doll…

Well truth be told.
You are far too lovely to do away with.

I've given some thought to finding a way for you to continue living.

Would you be interested in being village chief?

Village chief?

Why not?
The girls here come from villages far and wide, and we need someone to take them under wing and teach them all about proper etiquette to decorum before they're sent off to the palace to begin their time in the service of his Majesty.

What kind of service? What becomes of them after they are sent to live with the king?

The Spiral King lavishes them with his affections.
It's a fair exchange.
They get to experience luxury that they can never even dream of knowing in living their underground [harbors/hovels].

The girls who are sent away to be with the king, they're dolls too, right?

Yes, that's right. And someday they'll be discarded, exactly like you were.


Don't underestimate those who were raised underground!
We'll bust outta this place in no time flat!

That hurt…

Brain hurt…!

It's no use.
All we are doing is hurting ourselves.

This bedrock is incredibly tough.
It's like nothing I've seen.

It's hopeless… Our bodies will give up before that rock.

We haven't so much scratched it.

It's enough to make you despair…

Is this the end for us?

If only Kamina was here…

So, this is what he meant.

Kamina once said to me.
"He's always the one who saves my ass."
"He's always the one who never gives up. Never"

He did?

It wasn't going well. My confidence was shot. I thought we were heading in the wrong direction.
I freaked out and kept asking myself. "Why did my dad make it up to the surface and I can't?"
Honestly, I was just acting tough.
Everyone was whining, and they stopped digging.
I guess I was finally at the end of my rope.
But Simon, he kept on drilling away.
His drilling let me put on a brave face.
By dumb luck, he broke through the last boulder right then.
We got really lucky.
But I have faith in all that luck, and in Simon, who brought us that luck in the first place.
Whenever I feel timid and weak, I feel like (I'm) losing confidence, I picture the sight of his back all hunched over, digging away.
I think to myself, "I'll refuse to be laughed at by that back."
Listen, Simon. Never forget this.
Believe in yourself.
Not in the Simon that I have faith in.
Not in the Kamina that you believe in, either.
Believe in the Simon-

-who believes in you!
Lagann?
Lagann!

Wait a minute. Was there a hole here before?

General Guame, there's no sign of the miniature Gunmen anywhere on the ship!

Don't give me that crap, you idiot!
It's gotta be there somewhere!
Tear the thing apart if you have to, just find it!

Y-Yes, sir!

Why are you in such a panic, Guame?
You're flustered.

What?

You're afraid of him, aren't you?
You're scared of Simon.

What? Who the hell is that?

Simon is the boy who first helped me when I went down to the surface.
I mean the boy who's always protecting me.
Simon will never lose to the likes of you!

I see. He's that thing's operator, isn't he?

Hey! Find the boy named Simon among the prisoners and bring him to me!

Yes, sir!

What about the executions?

Everything is ready.

Excellent. The first one we will put to death is this Simon boy.

I'll never let you do that!

I'm the one who gets to decide such things.
Now why don't you just be a good little discarded doll and do what I tell you to do from now on?

I won't.

You don't say? I'm afraid in that case, you'll have to die, too.

I will not!

You what?

I may be just another of his cast-off dolls, but I have learned something on the surface!

What is that?

Just as Simon believed in his Bro, I believe in my Simon!

So, you won't yield, not even at your demise. You're too naive.
I have lost interest in you.
Good bye!
What?
How?

I don't believe it. What are you doing here, Gramps?

Nia! I'm here to rescue you!
Come on!

Simon!

Come with us, Gramps.
Huh?

Come back!

General Guame!

Get back mini Gunmen!

I'm sorry I took so long.

That's okay.

I figured it out. And well, I guess Lagann told me, too. And now I understand!

So do I. Thanks a lot, Simon!
Simon, move your hands.

What?

There.

All right.

This is why, I always say humans are savages!

Oh, crap!

Consider the tables turned, humans!
You've thrown a wrench into my plans, so now I'm going to execute you myself!
The sight of my mighty Gember and that of your own pathetic miserable deaths will be projected above the heads of every human on the surface!

Say what, you big bastard?!

I'm the one you're going to fight!

You think that toy is any match for my Gember?
What's wrong?

What the?
That thing is eating Gurren!

Take that! And that! And just a little more!

Rossiu!

Simon?

Let's combine!

You got it!

Damn it! It's that mini Gunmen!

I don't believe it! Is this the Gurren Lagann I've heard about?

My Bro is dead.
He's gone.
But he's right there on my back! And here in my heart!
He lives on as part of me!
If you're gonna dig, dig to the heavens.
No matter what's in my way, I won't stop!! Once I've done through, it means that I've won!

You what? What are you talking about?

Just who the hell do you think I am?
I'm Simon.
I'm not my Bro.
I'm ME!
Simon the Digger!

Spare me your childish ranting!
Gember Press!

Finishing Move!

No way.

That move was a...

GlGA DRlLL BREAK!!

Sound the retreat!
Run.

Please Simon, there's someplace that I'd like you to take me.
These are all princesses who were thrown away like I was.
All the generations of those who came before me.

You mean all of these?

I'd like to give them all a proper burial in a sunny place if you could help.

Yeah!
You got it!

To me, Father was my entire world.
My whole life, I'd believed in no one but him. Relied on no one but him.
That's why I wanted so desperately to believe in him until the very end.
Why is it we all were born?
I wonder...

Nia, here.

What?

You can have it. I found it while I was digging earlier.

It's pretty!

It's hard to explain, but it doesn't matter why you were born or what you were.
The Nia you are right here and now is what it counts.
That's why you should go on being yourself.

And I'll just be myself, too.

Yeah, that's more like it.
That's the Team Dai-Gurren way.
Ain't that right, Leader?

What?

You're the one, the one Kamina picked for the job.

Yeah, but I think the speech you gave is pretty half-assed, though.

What? H-Hey, come on!

Yeah, she's right! That needs a little work!

Thank you so much!

I've input the location of the Capital. All we do now is keep going straight.


The salty air, the blazing sun.
This is the beach?
Is it a large pool of soft water?
Or a large reservoir of hard feelings?
Next time on Gurren Lagann, Yoko, Will You Do Me a Favor?

Hey, little bro.
How are you?
I’m still in Varanasi.
Congrats and (passing).
Sorry, this is late.
Here, you ended up in going to Kami high, my ().
Now that you are officially in high school.
Let me give you some sisterly advice.
Join the classic lit club.
It’s one of the oldest club this school has.
And, I was in it my whole time there.
From what I’ve been told, it doesn’t have a single member right now.
If no one new joins this year, the executive committee will do away with it.
As one of the (federents), I couldn’t bear to see that happened.
Please Hotaro, join the classic lit club and help keep the legacy alive.
My adolescence memories are at stake.
It’s not like you have anything better to do, right?
Sincerely, your sister, Tomoe.

Baseball 
One, two, three, four.


It’s been a month since we (set) the classic lit club.
Starting feel at home in the art science prep room.


Good afternoon.


When I get bored after school, it is the first place I go.
I never expected to feel that way in there but I’m not complaining.


Want some?
I brought some snacks from home.
You’re welcome whatever you want.


Thank you.
It’s not that I ever just like spending time with other people, as long as they want kind wormy outer anything.


It’s pointless.


Yeah, as (like a adult pencil)?


What?
What are you talking about?
Was that supposed to be a joke?


Yeah, sorry.


Look, I’m not in the mood for jokes now.


OK, fine then.


I said it’s pointless.


What.


All the time we’ve been wasting in here after school everyday, doing absolutely nothing productive.


I don’t have problem with that.
But, is there something specific you want to do with your time in the classic lit club?


Yeah, there is.


Wow.


But, that’s more of a personal matter.


She said that before.


Right now, I’m talking about something different.
If we’re going to a legit club, we need some good activities.


That’s pointless.


Wait, hear me out.
Let’s () anthology to the cultural festival.


Seriously?


Yep.


Let’s not.
Sounds like a ton of work.


No, we have to have an anthology.


Look, if you really wanna participate in the festival, there much easier ways to do it.
Like concessions.


Kami high school has never allowed students to sell concessions.
Anyway, it will give us a budget for an anthology.
And our advising teacher has requested to create one.
Also, it’s been a tradition for this club to create one for the festival for the past four decades.
They don’t wanna break that.


Well then, why didn’t you mention all that sooner.
That means we have to do it.


Great.


So, what is this () anthology supposed to contain, anyway.


I have no idea.


Are you kidding me?


Yeah, sorry.
I thought you and I could look into it together.
I figured if there any anthologies from previous years line around, we can start there.
Why don’t we search for them?


I give up.


Maybe they are in the library.
Let’s check it out.
Why are you still sitting there.
You’re coming with me.
Get up.


I’m not in the mood for this.
It’s Friday which means that it’s her shift on library duty.


Well well, it’s Oreki.
Long time no see, (can’t say missed you).


Hey Ibara, nice to see you too.


This is the sacred lawn of knowledge.
Your presence here defiles all that.


Oh, yeah.
I’m () that you are in charge of books.
Do you even know how to read?


You haven’t changed at all.
If you (can’t) insult me, you should just leave.


Excuse me.


Hey Hotaro, how’s it going.
Looks like you two are closest always.
Seems about right for the cutest couple in middle school.


Ridiculous.


Don’t be disgusting.
(I’ve rather data slab, then miss low life.)


Have you ().


Over the line, Fukube.
And, you’ve got a lot of nerve making a joke when you () I feel.


I’m sorry, Mayaka.
How you feelings?


Do you even care that your points insulted my wounds?
Not cool.
Seriously, I have a heart, OK?


I don’t understand what’s going on here.


She () crash on him ever since middle school.


Chitanda, I would like you to meet Mayaka Ibara.
We all went to Kaburaaya middle school together.


Nice to meet you. 


Mayaka, this is Eru Chitanda.
She is a president of the classic lit club which I joined recently.


Yes, indeed.
It’s a real pleasure to meet you.


So, anyway, what brings you to the library?


Oh right, I almost forgot.
So, ah, Mayaka, I was wondering if you might be able to help us.


I’ll try.


There’s a library happen to have any club anthologies?
Like classic lit club, maybe.


Let me see.
I don’t think so actually.
At least not in here, maybe in the back.


Oh, OK.


So, why are you looking for them?


We’ve decided our club should make one for the cultural festival.
So, we want to get past anthologies to get some ideas.


Oh yeah, are we gonna present it in Kanya-sai?
I can’t believe Hotaro agree to that.


I was pressured into it as a matter of fact.
Kanya-sai?


Abbreviation.
Kamiyama high cultural festival.


Is this anther one of those terms you make up and try to coin?


No, for real.
That’s what everyone here in the school calls it, not just me.
Right?


Yeah, Kanya-sai is what they call it in manga club.


Kanya…
Wait, how did they spells that anyway?


I have no idea.
I asked around, but I haven’t got an answer.
I bet it started as Kamiyama high bunkasai.
Then shortened into Kamiyama-sai, Kanyama-sai, Kanya-sai.
That’s my hypothesis, but who knows.


Anyway, Chitanda, there might be old anthologies back in the storage stocks.
But, the librarian is in meeting right now.
We can’t get back there unless she unlocks it.
I think her meeting will be done in about thirty minutes or so.
Wanna wait?


What should we do.


We should wait.


You could always leave and come back.


Yeah, Yeah…


Wait, Hotaro, hold up.
Hey Mayaka, you should tell these guys the story you told me earlier.


Huh!?
OK, fine.
Oreki, do you feel like using your tiny brain for once in your life?


No.


What story are you going to tell?


It’s called the most favorite book of disfavor.


The most favorite book of disfavor?


It’s quite a peculiar tale.
No matter how I slice it, doesn’t seen to add up.
It’s got Mayaka and me pretty much stuck.


Please tell us all of the details.


I’ve report here for duty every Friday after school, you know?
And, every week the same book () returned like clock work.
Today, makes five weeks in a row.
That’s () of itself kind of a weird, right?
This is the book.


Wow, what a gorgeous book.


It’s huge.


Is it OK if I look inside?


Go ahead.


Oreki, you should see this.
It’s about the school’s history, huh.
I can’t believe how dense it is.
This should be a lot of work to read.


It’s not weird for someone to check this out every week. 
They never finish.


You’ve obviously never borrowed from this school’s history.
Check out period, here’s full two weeks instead of just one.
So, why would someone need to get it more often than that.
Nevertheless, someone always does.
And, turns it in every week too.


Do you have the record of borrowers?


Yeah, off course.
Check out lists is in front cover, see?


Oreki, this is odd.
Each Friday, a different person checks this book out, but they always bring it back that same day.


Exactly, this giant book has been checked out and returned every Friday for five weeks in a row now.
Even the times are consistent.
All of five kids come to get it during lunch and returned it after school.


What do you think?
You’re curious, right?


Yes.
I just I have to know.
Let’s try to figure this out, Oreki?
You (want) too?


Damn you Satoshi.
You knew this would happen when you stopped me from leaving, did you?


Hey, () such a great job solving that locked door mystery?
And, then it was the strange business with the secret club.


Wait, what are you talking about?


She would be referring to a rather provocative (fastive) Hotaro here.


Stop, you are making a sound dirty.


In any case, this is curious, right?


Ahhh, no it’s not.


Yes, it is.


It’s not.


Enough.
Be quiet, both of you.


Right.


Sorry.
I got reckless.
Any further refusal can result in careless waste of precious energy
That can happen.
That in mind.
Yeah, all right.
I guess I will think about it, OK?


Great.


Fukube, has Oreki ever been smart as like?


No, not like us.
But, he does have neck for solving problems which can come in handy sometimes.


Hey, don’t talk about () like I’m not here.
For five weeks straight, different people () check this book out and returned it few hours later.
Lesser minds might shrug it off as a coincidence, but Chitanda wouldn’t be content that answer
The truth is what matters here.
What’s important is satisfying her burning curiosity.
Now then, borrowing the book at lunch hour then returning it after school doesn’t allow sufficient time to read.
If they didn’t (log) around such a tone, they could just read it in the library without borrowing.
Conclusion, this book is not been utilized for literary purposes at all.
They are not reading it.
What is that mean?
If are books not been useful for reading, what other purpose could it serve?


If you stock them up, make decent pillows.


They make good shields in combat too.


Are you ever serious about anything?


He is right.
These people can’t be reading it, so what could they be doing with that book?


Well Chitanda, what do you think?


Let me see.
Someone could use them as weights in a workout.


You guys are no help at all.
If Chitanda really as smart as everyone claim she is, she seems like a total doofus to me.
Let’s try something else.
What does it mean that a different person borrows this book every week.
(Off) from the names, we can guess that are all girls.
This brings up two possibilities.
The girls have no connection.
It’s involved to have this book on Friday afternoons.
So, they’ve all checked it out on different occasions by coincidence.
Or, the five (of them) used the book together as a group, and then each take turns being the one to borrow () Friday.


Invoke, huh?


For fortune telling.


Right.
Like this book will be lucky charm on Friday, so take it with you.
If you check it out during your lunch period and return it after school, your boy friend will (play) kiss on you.
Heck yeah?


Outstanding.
That’s the damnedest thing I’ve ever heard.


I’m just brain storming in here.


All they have in common is that the girls and second years.
They’re all in different classes.
Why would the fact that the girls have anything to do with this book.


Who knows?
Might not.
Think about it, if you randomly selected five students from this school, there’s a pretty decent chance they would all be female.


It’s also pretty common for members of the same sex to stick together


What if they are using some kind of code?
Like if they returned it facing up, it has particular meaning, face down () means something else.


I don’t think that would be a very effective code at all.
You see?


She’s right.
Any face up face down code would be lost in there.


Well, no matter how hard you think, Oreki is not gonna figure it out.
After all, Fukube and I wrapped our brains couldn’t get it.
Hey, what’s wrong?


It has a peculiar smell.


Wait, it does?
I don’t smell anything.


I swear it stinks.
There’s sort of (acolet order).
It’s like paint thinner.
It’s unmistakeable.


Is she a dog?


Well, if Chitanda () smells something strange on that thing, then it’s worth looking into, don’t you think?


What could that mean?


Hotaro, if you cracked it open, and then you’ve gotta say so.


Did you get it?


Calm down, maybe, but not sure.
Hey Chitanda, you wanna get some exercise?
There’s a lead I want you to investigate.


Let’s get ride on it.


No, I’m not going this time.
It’s just you.


Just me?
Don’t you need to go?


Yeah!
Good job, Chitanda.
Hotaro has got no right to use you like that.
He’s at his best when you are the one taking advantage of him.


I’m not using, anyway.


No, it’s not like that.
I just figured out we would investigate together.


Right, that make sense.


What are you waiting for.
Then let’s get going.
Thank you so much for coming.
We are honored to serve you.
We have prepared two fine menus for you tonight.
Which one would you prefer?
I recommend this dish for you.


This might end up costing you more than you think.


Are you OK?


Let’s go.
After all, gym class got rained out today.
So, I think I have exactly enough energy to spare.


Great.


What kind of guy you are () such a deficit of energy.


Shut up.
All right, come on then.


Right.


Hold on.
I’m going with you.
I’m kinda curious.
Fukube, would you watch the dest till I get back?
I mean I can’t just walk away from my library duty, right?


You hold down the (folk).
Later.
Don’t have too much fun.


So, where are you taking us to investigate now, Oreki?


To check out the art room.


Wow, all the way over there?


Yeah, that’s far, which is why I didn’t wanna go in the first place.


You have to be the laziest person I’ve ever met.


What’s in the art room.


First, let’s set a few things straight.
I’m willing to bet none of those girls would have time to get any use out of that book on the break.
It’s too enormous for that, which means they could only really do anything with that during class time.
What if the only class is made up of students who are in the same year but in different homerooms?


Gym and all the fine arts subjects, right?


Yep.
So every week before class, those five girls and each take turns can borrow the book.


I still don’t understand the timing, though.
I mean they can check out for two weeks if they want it.


The book is huge.
So, they probably just one of the class, rather than (log) it around.


That make sense.
What is it?


It’s the same smell as the book.


Seriously?


Look in the room and you’ll see why.
There is the answer (what you look) mystery.
The second year combined D, E and F classes are just using at an art as a prop when they model for portrait painting.
The books binding makes (it) ideal picture (as) motif.


It was the (snue) of paint, not thiner.


How did you figure it out.


Huh, what do you mean?
It came to me, I guess.
I just got lucky.


Wow, nicely done, my friend.
Students using it as a prop for art class.
It’s the last thing I would have imagine.


I still don’t know how you did it.
You’re just weird.


No, I’m not.
Probably the most normal person at this school.


Well, that’s a bit strong.


Still, that’s a really impressive detective work, Oreki.
I’m completely fascinated by what goes on inside a head of yours.


Fascinated?


Yes.
I just (love to) crack open your skull and pick your brain sometime, you know? 


That’s sounds like a horror movie to me.
Plus, to an honor student like you, it’s not that remarkable of your brain.


Oh, yeah?
You are an honor student?


Let me put it in this way.
We haven’t had midterms yet, but I’m sure () Chitanda’s gonna be a top of our class.


No way.
It doesn’t matter how good our grades are.
That can’t compare all to his (rolled) ability.
Taking a little clues and piece it together into a (lead) that actually (pounds) out and just incredible.


(), her senses of smelling and hearing fascinate me.
They (would) solve this mystery end in the last.


Oreki might even… be able to…
Oh, ah, nothing.


Anyway, I have fun with this even though I missed the best part.
What about you?


Yeah, I had a (grasp).
The afternoon flew by before I knew it.


I spent hours gripping over.
I still couldn’t even get close.
It’s so frustrating.


Didn’t I tell you he can come in handy one some while?


I can’t stand (sort of) being (standing out) by Oreki.
I still feel my life is over now.


Come on.
It’s not that bad.


It’s odd.
Something just doesn’t feel right.
I can’t receive myself acting like they are right now.
Why is that.
There’s something wrong with me?


Yeah, I know what you mean.
Once he’s got a (scent).
There’s a brilliant flash and instantly he knows everything.


Oreki, you can’t leave yet.


Why not?
Oh right, the anthologies.


Yeah, we have some (waits) the librarian gets back.


Hotaro does kind of zone out sometimes.


Not just sometimes.
He is always out to (lunch).


Ibara, thank you for watching the desk for me.
You’re free to go now.


Oh, good.
It was my pleasure, Ms. Itoigawa


Ma’am, my name’s Satoshi Fukube.
We are from the classic lit club.
We hope you might be able to help us.
Where could we find old anthologies?


Classic lit?
Anthologies?
You are in the classic literature club?
Well, unfortunately, we don’t currently have any of the back numbered issues anywhere in the stocks.


Are you sure about that?


If they are here, son, trust me, I would know.
Now, if you excuse me, I’m busy.


Well, thank you anyway.
I guess we are out of luck, Chitanda.


This is a big problem.


We’ll find them soon enough.


So Oreki, was it frustrating not being able to solving a problem for once?


Not really.


Whatever.


That’s that, then.
We should go home.
I did learned something helpful though.


Yeah, what’s that?


Nothing.
It’s a personal matter.


Oh, that again, huh?


Yeah.
Now, () Oreki, it might be possible after all.


Well, this is Oreki.


Good morning.
It’s Chitanda.


Chitanda?


Yeah.
I’m sorry if I woke you up, did I?


Oh, no.
I thought it might be my sister or something.
So, are you calling on sunday?


I’m sorry.
But I want to see you today if that’s possible.
There’s something I really want to talk to you about.


She’s late.


Hi, thank you for waiting.
I rushed right over.


Uh-huh.
So, is there something you wanted to talk about?
I’m just curious that why you want to meet me here at this weird coffee shop.


You are the one who recommended this place, not me, Oreki?


Later.


No, please don’t go.


It’s my precious Sunday to do nothing.
I won’t wast this sitting in this place with you playing these games.


What, I’m sorry.
It’s just (), I’m really nervous, OK?


What is there to be so nervous about?
Are you about to make a confession?
Tell me that you love me?


There may be something I’d like to confess to you, yes.

Sis, come on!
You'd better get out of bed!
Sis?!


Ah, it's eight!
I'm late!


Hey you, why the rush?
Hmm?


See you later!


Oh, good morning, Yui.


Uh, good morning!

What?
I read the clock wrong!

Starting today, I'm a high schooler!


-- OP --



Congratulations on starting school here!

Girl 1
Please join the Tennis Club!

Girl 2
The Judo Club's better!

Girl 3
Please join the Tea Ceremony Club!

Girl 4
Please join the Abacus Club!


Please! Please!


Uh...

Huh? Hmm...


What are you groaning about, Yui?


Hmm? Oh, hello, Nodoka.
I'm not sure which club I should join in.


What? You haven't decided on one?
It's already been two weeks since school started.
You have to choose!


But I'm absolutely terrible at every sport, and I don't really get any of the literary clubs.


Huh. This is how people end up becoming NEETs.


You're pegged as a NEET just 'cause you don't join a club?


You know, looking back on it, for as long as I've known you, you've never joined a single club, have you?


Crud!
I really do feel like I ought to at least try to do something.
But what the heck should I be doing?


#1 Disband the Club!



Mio!


Ritsu?


Let's go check out the club!


Which club do you mean?


The Light Music Club!
What do you think?


But I was planning on joining the Literature Club.


Huh?


I've already filled out the application form.


Hmm... Rip.


Ah! What do you think you're doing?


Come on, let's go! Move it, move it!


Cut it out!



Huh? It's disbanded?!


Well, on the verge of being disbanded.
All the students who were in the club last year have now graduated, so the club will be disbanded unless four students join this month.


Oh, so that's why there wasn't anyone in the Music Room...


Miss Yamanaka!


Hi, Yui. I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, I have a music class to teach in a few minutes.
Light Music Club, good luck!


She sure was pretty, wasn't she?


That is not the issue here.


Oh...

Ritsu, 
Oh.


Please hand out the syllabus sheets to all the students.

The syllabus sheets?


Oh, right! So sorry about that!
Huh? They're staring at me!


Bad tempo.
She's useless.


I'm so sorry!


Are you all right?


And clumsy.


It's being disbanded, so that's that.
I'm gonna go join the Literature Club.


If I join and there aren't any members, does that make me the club president?
Doesn't sound bad at all!


What was that club you were talking about with those girls?


The Light Music Club?


Yeah, what is it?


The Light Music Club is about playing lighthearted music.


Light Music Club?


That's right.
The Light Music Club?



So, what's your plan, Ritsu?


We wait for prospective members!


We just wait.


Wait!


Come on, let's go home.


Hello, I wanted to find out about joining your club.


Ah, the Light Music Club?


No, I'm at the Choir Club.


Why not join the Light Music Club instead?


But, the Choir Club...


We need more members like you!


What?


Please! I'm begging you!
You won't regret it, I promise!


Don't try to force her to join like that!
It's really rude!
I'm going now. I'm sorry.


Mio!


What about that promise we made?
Was that just a big lie?!
That I would play drums!
And you would play the bass!
Our band!
We've been saying forever that we would start one.
We promised each other, remember?!
That night we went to see that concert together!


This is it.


This is, isn't it?


Were those sweet words nothing but a big lie?!


No, your flashback is.


What? Really it is?


Mio, this is it!
You and I are going to play in a band together!
Is that exciting?!


You forced the idea on me.


Yeah, but you said you wanted to!


Yes, I did, but...


And if we went pro, we said we'd split all the proceeds 70/30!


Don't make stuff up.
Huh?


Uh...


This will be a great deal of fun.
The only instrument I can play is the keyboard.
But I'd like to join your club if you'll have me.


Uh... Thank you so much!
Now we only need one more person to join us!


Oh, I suppose that means I'm already a member.


Uh... You're...


Tsumugi Kotobuki.


I'm Ritsu Tainaka, drums.
This is Mio Akiyama, she's on bass.
Let's see... Now we need a guitar player!



Yui?


My high school years are very important.
I wanna do something...


Well, then do it.


But I have absolutely no idea what it is I should do!


Oh, good grief...


Would you like any french fries with that, Miss?


Uh, yes, I would love some, thank you.


Thank you.


What is it?


This is my first time eating in a fast food restaurant!


How can that be?


I know it's silly but I've always dreamed of having someone ask me if I wanted french fries.


Huh?


Oh, I'm sorry. Please begin the meeting.


Oh. 'Kay, this meeting's come to order!
Our goal is to recruit one more member by the end of the month!


How in the world do we do that?


That's why we're meeting to think of a way right now!
For instance, offering people an amazing prize if they decide to join!


An amazing prize?


Yeah. Like some kind of gift or something.


Like a car or a plane or a boat?


Amazing but impractical.


More along the lines of ice cream or help with homework.


Who would join up for something like that?


What should we do, then?


Hmm...



Nyororin...


The president shouldn't lose interest!


Come up with something to keep me interested.


I wanna go home.


For now, why don't we...



One, two!


There's just one more week remaining in April.


No one's answered our ads yet.


Disbanded before we are a band.


I won't let that happen!


Huh? Hmm...
Wait, Light Music, huh?

Here, my click, clack, click, clack, here [high] is a click...


You're very good at that, Yui.


Hahaha!


I'm gonna do it!

-- EYE CATCH --


For the time being, I have decided to join the Light Music Club!


Oh, yeah?
So, what is it that they do at this club?


Dunno.


Huh?


But since the name of the club is "light music," I figured they only do really easy stuff.
You know like whistling.


Sounds like they don't have much ambition.

You see? It looks like they're some kind of band.


What? But I don't know how to play the guitar!


Well then, what can you play?


Um... I can play castanets.

Uh, click, clack, click...


That's a perfect fit for you.



See? Look at this here...


What's with that?


Good afternoon.


Good afternoon.


A prospective member has come forward.


Oh!


Here. Isn't that wonderful news?
Also that's a lovely tea set, but make sure you clean up after yourselves once you're done, all right?


All right!


Yes! Now we won't be disbanded!


Yui Hirasawa...


Just her name makes her sound really awesome!


She's got to be a guitarist.


I can't wait to meet her.


Yeah! A real powerhouse has joined us!


Light Music Club...
Light Music Club...

If I don't get down this hallway, I won't reach the Light Music Club!


Oh, hello.


The Light Music Club is up in the Music Room.


This is the place?
And it won't be an easy thing to say right after joining, but I've got to quit.
I wonder what kind of people would join a Light Music Club?

Krauser 
Oh, you want to quit, do you?
Did you think you could walk away without any consequences?!
I'll murder you!


What am I gonna do?!
Ahh!
You've got it all wrong!
You've got it all wrong!


What? It's the useless clumsy bad tempo girl!
What is it you're doing?


You startled me.


Uh, you are Yui Hirasawa by any chance?


Y-Yes.


The girl who wants to join us?


Y-Yes.


I'm so sorry I misjudged you!
I'm sure you must be totally awesome on guitar!
We've all been waiting for you to get here!


It seems like someone's been embellishing things about me...


Hey, guys!
Our brand-new member has arrived!


Is that her?


Aha!


Welcome to the Light Music Club!


It's so good to have you here!


Right! Mugi, go get the tea ready!


Okay.


What should I do?


Go ahead, it's quite delicious.


Wow, this is great!

This is so good!

Maybe I should give up on trying to quit...


What kind music do you like to play?


Huh?


Who's your all time favorite band?
Which guitarists do you like?


Uh...
Oh my... I have to tell them.
I can't really play the guitar at all!
J... J... J...


Oh, are you trying to say Jimi Hendrix?!


Wow.


No, it's not. I mean, I don't...


Jimmy Page, then?!


No! Oh, no, I ju... ju...


Jeff Beck?!


Are there really this many guitarists whose names start with "J"?!


Oh, wow, Jeff Beck, that's cool!


Who is he?


In the music world, they say that there's only two kind of rock  Jeff Beck, and everyone else.
He's a brilliant and challenging guitarist who's always searching for new sounds.


My goodness.


You're so hardcore, Miss Hirasawa!
I gotta say I'm so glad that someone like her joined the club.


We were at the point where the club would have been disbanded if we hadn't gotten another member within the next week.


Thank you so much for joining!


They keep making it harder!
But I'm... I'm just going to have to spit it out!
Um, I'm really sorry, I don't know how to say it if I made a mistake joining this club but I only came here to beg you to let me quit!


What?


I can't play the guitar.
I thought you would be playing a different kind of instrument.


What instrument can you play, then?


Casta... Er, the harmonica.


Oh, I have a harmonica right here.
Try playing something!


Oh, sorry, I can't play it!


But, Miss Hirasawa, if you wanted to join this club, that means that you're at least interested in music, right?


Is there another club you'd rather join?


Uh, no, none in particular.


We can't let this mark leave this room no matter what!


To keep the club from being disbanded...


We have to keep her here somehow!


I'm sorry, I really mean it. Bye.


Wait just a minute!


How about another cup of tea?


But I...


We have cookies and madeleines as well.


Mm-hm.


They're baiting the hook!


So good...
I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come here and gorge myself.


Hey, don't sweat it!


I think we should start eating snacks like this every day from now on.


Aren't we drifting off topic here... Ow!


Miss Hirasawa, what other sorts of things do you like?


Oh, I like anything that tastes good.


Geez, just food?

On your days off, do you spend your time at home doing anything in particular?


Just sitting around, I guess.


What kind of things do you like?


Um, I like cute things, I guess.


Have any weaknesses?


I'm not very good with extreme heat or cold.
I spend winter under the table where it's warm.
And in the summer, I spend my time on the floor where it's cool.


She's a tough one.


What the heck do we do?


I don't know.


Um, I should go.


Please, don't go, I'm begging you!
You can just hang out and do nothing if you want!


I'll try to bring even tastier snacks, okay?


I'm really sorry.
I didn't take things seriously when I applied to join.
I got all your hopes up.
How can I ever apologize?


We're the ones who should apologize.


We shouldn't have tried to force you to stay.


So please!
At least hang around for a while and listen to us play a song!


You'll play a song for me?!


She's swallowed the bait!


Oh,..


One, two, three, four!


What did you think?


I don't know what to say...
It's really hard to put into words!


Mm-hm.


You guys aren't very good, are you?


Talk about blunt!


But it seemed like it would be a whole lot of fun to do!
I decided that I'm going to join this club!


Banzai!
Excuse me.
Okay, let's commemorate the start of the Light Music Club!


Hey, that's my camera.


Here we go, guys!


But the problem is that I can't play any instruments at all.
Can I be a manager or something?


Well, we aren't a sports club.


I know, why don't you take this opportunity to begin learning the guitar?


But it looks very complicated!
I don't think I could...


Don't worry about it.
Between the three of us, we'll teach you everything you need to know.


I guess you're right.
Listening to you play just now made me feel like I can do at least that well, if not a lot better!


So glad to be of help.



What? You went ahead and joined anyway?


Mm-hm. They practically begged me to join!


Seriously?!
Oh, as a manager or something, right?


When someone else says it, it sounds insulting.
I joined as a full-fledged member of the band.
And they say they'll teach me to play guitar!


Oh, that means you're gonna have to go out and buy yourself a new guitar.


I wonder if they'll let me borrow one?


Probably not.


You can buy them for about $50, right?


Oh, boy.
I wonder if the Light Music Club knows what they're getting themselves into with this girl.


Hehehe.


Hey, everyone!
These three are my fellow Light Music Club members.


I wanted to pick a club where I could make friends with sort of fun, pleasant people that one so rarely meets.


Y-Yui?


All right!
Let's get to it!
Go!


Hey, guys!
Ow!

Now that I finally made it to high school.
I've joined a club for the first time!
Sit tight. That dizzy romantic comedy School Rumble is about to start.

So, Harima. Now we’ll settle this once and for all.
Let’s get him!

Even in the worst situations, when a man’s in love, he can’t afford to lose his pride.

Tch. You bastard. Arggg.

Bring it on, losers. You can’t beat me because I’m in love. And it’s all for you, Tenma.

Harima comes to school every day now, doesn’t he?
Maybe he’s planning some sort of bomb threat.

Tenma. You took off without your lunch.

Oh, silly me. Thanks, sis.

Listen, are you okay sitting there? Is it safe?

Say what?

He’s got kind of a weird vibe.

Oh, Harima. Look. Your desk. It’s crushing your bag. You poor helpless little bag.

Everything I do is for you. I never gave a damn about school. I came and went as I pleased.
But you turned it into a paradise I can’t live without. Hmhm. Pretty hysterical.
The toughest punk in town and I show up on time every day, stay all day and then stick around for clean-up. Hahahaha. What a joke… on me. You get it? Hahaha…

Okay. That’s just weird.

Yup. No doubt about it. He’s planning something evil.

[opening song]

Right. Time to check out the old language skills with a pop quiz.
Just fill in the blanks, people.

Okay, and start!

Too many letters… Brain hurting… School is hard.
Oh well, it’s worth it to be near Tenma. I should just enjoy this moment of bliss.
Ah! But wait, her name! She forgot to write in her name.
Is she crazy? If she forgets to write her name in, she’ll get an automatic zero.
If she gets an automatic zero, she’ll fail. Oh my god. She’s gonna fail! Tenma’s gonna fail! Ten-
Ah, I can’t warn her out loud. We’re in the middle of the test.
What should I do? Think, Harima. Think!
Time to be a hero and save the girl. I’ve got it! I’ll try mouthing the words.
Oh crap. That didn’t work. This is tougher than I thought. Okay then.
Damn it. So far I’m dead in the water. Come on, Harima. You’ve gotta come up with a better idea.
There’s gotta be another way to warn her. Heroes always have a plan B. Oh well.
I hate to be so obvious, but I guess I’ll have to take the direct route.

Arghhhh. Holy crap. I completely forgot to write my name.
Even if I'd managed to get every answer correct, I would’ve failed.

Better be more careful, Harima.

Everyone’s laughing at me. Still, anything for Tenma. She’s laughing at me too?!?
But I was talking about her. Hasn’t she ever heard of learning from other people’s mistakes?
And why does she have to be so cute?

Oh dear!

Screw you!

Sorry.

I can’t give up yet. There. It’s perfect. Yeahaha.
Wow, I got the answer to number 7, the last question. Man, this test is so easy I can’t believe it.
Here we go.

Hm?

Did she get it?

Oh no, no. How does this happen?
This girl is just too stupid and I know stupid. Damn it.
What haven’t I tried?

Amazing. Harima really seems to be concentrating on this test.

It’s like he’s actually trying or something.

Hold on. What if I wrote Tenma’s name on my paper so that her no-name paper would be mistaken for mine? Yes.

What’s this? Sir, this paper has my name on it but this isn’t my handwriting.

What? Strange. Harima turned in a paper with no name.

Did Harima do this to protect me? What a sweetie.

It was you, wasn’t it?

I just can’t turn my back on someone who needs help.

Oh, Harima. I love you.

Ditto.

(Anybody knows what’s going on? What’s up with him?))
It’ll work. Tenma. I’m doing this for the sake of our future happiness.

Here your test papers from yesterday.
Tenma, I’m afraid you got a zero.

What the…

Ugh. I’m sorry, Tenma! I’m so sorry. Please forgive me. I’m just so stupid.

What do you think? Shall we hit the coffee shop or the mall?

I don’t care.

I can’t. There’s a sale at the supermarket today and I have to go.
I’ve gotta do the dinner shopping. Let’s see. What sounds good tonight?

Whoa. Are you trying to tell me that you do the cooking at your house? C’mon.

Huh? Yea, well. That is, I…

I thought Yakamo did all the cooking.

You’re right. She does.

I knew it.

I always thought Tenma looked like the spoiled one.

What, really? Agh!
Karasuma. Wait. Why did I hide from him just now?
I guess I was embarrassed to let the boy I love see me coming out of the girl’s bathroom.
Oh great. Now that I thought of it, I can’t go out. I’m such a moron.
It’s just the girl’s bathroom but I pee in here. What'll I do?

Okay I really need to get out now.

Still there. Come on. Why is he being such an idiot?
Why would anyone stand around talking for so long in front of the girl’s bathroom.
But that’s why I love the guy. Argh, no. This is no time to be blinded by love.

Still at it. Okay, now it’s a matter of endurance.
I’ll show him what a woman’s willpower can do. Love isn’t for wimps.
I’m being tested. No problem. I can handle it. Besides, he can’t talk longer than ten minutes. Haha.

It oughta be safe by now.
Oh man, does it ever get to see daylight again.
I-I don’t believe it. He’s reading a novel?

Plan number two.

Uh… Where the heck did she go?
Hey, Tenma. You’re still in here?

Okay, it doesn’t matter just as long as he doesn’t recognize me.

What are you doing now?

Uh?

Hah. You’re just in time. Quick. Who am I?

Eh. Yea. Tenma. I’ll be going home now.

Huh? Hang on. How did you know it was me?

Wow, little too much for me.

Plan number three. I’ll use this to distract Karasuma and then make my escape.

One, two, GO!

Okay, who’s the wise guy, huh? You got a lot of nerve sneaking up on me.
Who did it? Was it you? Was it? Spit it out. [??? If I have to I can…]

Sorry about that, Harima. I’ll apologize to him later.

There’s nothing left I can use. And I’m all out of plans.
I’m gonna spend the rest of my life in the girl’s bathroom.
Huh? It’s stuck.
Wait a sec.

Ready on the left. Ready on the right. All systems go! 30 meters! Slow descend, begin!
I’m not giving up. There’s no way I’m gonna let Karasuma see me leaving the girl’s bathroom.
It’s a matter of pride. I finally made it at last.

You’re okay?

Yea, I’m fine.

Well, just be careful. You’re lucky you didn’t get hurt.

Come on, sis. I told you before. I’m not mad at you for missing the sale at the supermarket today, okay.

No, no. That’s not the problem.

Oh, please. I beg you. I hope you’ll be kind. I haven’t done this for a long time.

Sis? Is there somebody in there with you?

No, no, no. It’s nothing, I mean nobody. I was just talking to…

To what? You mean you were talking to the scale?
Oh right. The school physicals tomorrow.

How can you be so calm? You lucky you’re so skinny.
Life is hard for us, full-figured girls. Hmph.
Now get out. I wanna be alone.

You fiend! Do your worst. You shall never beat me!

I don’t wanna be unsympathetic but I don’t think you can blame the scale.

Okay, girl. Do it.
I hope we can be friends.
Hahhhh!

It’s a nightmare. I gotta wake up. That’s all.

Get off the floor before you catch a cold.

(I skipped breakfast today.
I haven’t eaten for three days.
[I can catch up with [bra/dress] size].
You’re gonna collapse.
After the weighing I’ll stuff myself.
All that, I mean, [one] bra size. It just isn’t fair.)

Okay, let me guess. The look on your face says you gained weight. Am I right?
Score one.

I’d just ignore her. You weigh about the same as me, don’t you?
So don’t even worry about it.

Thank you.

On the other hand, she’s got a much bigger bust than you do.

Let’s see. A… no, no. B, definitely. And this one, A I think.

Imadori.
Hey. Are you trying to guess blood types?

Bra sizes, my friend. Yea I can tell at a glance. It’s a gift.
I don’t even need to measure, though I could if I wanted to.

Smile for me. That’s it, baby. Give me more of that.
Ah, that’s a ticket. Work it, girl. Work it. The camera loves you.

Okay. I know I probably shouldn’t ask this, but what are you doing?

I’m taking early graduation pictures, of course. What does it look like?

Then I guess you don’t think that’s asking for trouble.

Fuyuki, I would like to order a complete set, please.

Are you guys nuts? You’re just begging for it.

Hey. Gimme that.

Give it back to me. That’s my dad’s camera.
Sorry, but as class representative, it’s my duty to confiscate [cameras being used for moral offenses].

You cannot deny the awesome power of the chocolate brownie.

I’m not arguing. I’m just saying I like the truffles better.

Word, yo. (True, yes.)

Which makes it 2-1. I win.

Karasuma’s gonna have his height and weight measured today too. I wonder…
He must be about 171, no, 172 cm. Weight. He looks light. Limber, too.
I’m no good at guessing a boy’s weight. Oh no, now I've done it. I can't stand it.
It’s gonna drive me crazy. I gotta know, I gotta know everything about him.
I gotta know his height, weight, shoe size, collar, sleeve length, waist, hip, inseam, glove size, hat size, chest…
His chest… is probably bigger than mine.

Hey, is it just me or has anyone else noticed that the boys are a little more out of control than usual.

Oh, they’re just getting all hot and bothered, thinking about today’s physical exam.

Ahh. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.

Sure thing. What are we forgiving you for?

You know, Tenma. No one else has a knack for killing a conversation quite like you did.

C’mon, Eri. You’ve gotta be used to it by now. Enjoy the drama.

Yeah. So, back to the boys. Isn’t it pathetic the way they’re wrapped up in their lewd little fantasies?
I mean if they’re that desperate to satisfy their curiosity, then they should just become doctors.

Wow, so much for being PC. [politically correct]

That’s right. Boys can be doctors or nurses.

Oh come on, you two. That was just a “for instance.” I wasn’t making a political statement.

Become a doctor or a nurse.
YES! I’ll become a nurse.

Huh?

Maybe I’m overreacting, but doesn’t that strike you as an abrupt career dicision?

Yeah, well . Consider the source.

Oh gosh, I think she’s really serious this time.

No, no. I’m not talking about my future job.

You’re sure about that?

I’ll see you all later, girls. So long.

Oh man, I thought she was serious.

Don’t relax. I sense a zany plan coming on.

There’s just no telling with her.

There. Talk about the perfect disguise.

That idiot. Her hair is a dead giveaway.

[At least] she didn’t put on a nose and glasses.

I don’t get it. What can she possibly be after?

This is kind of fun. I don’t think I’ve had to wear a name tag since grade school.

You have to give her credit. She can have fun doing anything.

I'll bet you 10-1 she’s filling out that card with her own name.

Gosh. What do you think we should do?

Nothing, of course.
C’mon. Don’t you wanna watch and see what happens next?

I argee. It’s probably better if we don’t interfere at this point.

So far, so good. Soon Oji Karasuma’s vital statistics will be all mine.

Sorry if I kept you waiting. I’m looking forward to working with you, Doctor.

No problem. I was running late myself. I’m subbing for the regular doctor.
Let me introduce myself. I’m young doctor Harima. Nice to meet you.

Attention please, students.
The physical examinations scheduled for today have been canceled.
Once again, the physical examinations scheduled for today have been canceled.
They will be rescheduled at a later time.

Ah, it’s so hard to say “I love you.” It’s easier to bend spoons with your mind.
I know. I’ll have a sleepover and invite my friends to share stories about their love troubles.
Next time on School Rumble, See and Sketch. Letter on an arrow. Pijama party confessions.
Mikoto. Your breasts are just so big.
Kosei playing the piano.

Tsubaki &  Kosei!

Takeshi, Emi & Nagi  Arima!

 Kosei!

 They're watching me. The people who comfort and challenge and guide me. The people who called me back to the stage. They're out there. So I, I can't let them down. This is the sound mom gave me. The sound that Watari would cheer for and Tsubaki always believe in. Forge in the heat of battle with Aiza and Igawa and polish made a duet with Nagi. The sound Hiroko helps me to remember.

Little  I can't hear. I can't hear the notes. Somebody.

 You have me.

 You were right you know? I'm not empty. I'm full of music waiting to escape and I'm not alone. From the first moment we meet somebody, we never alone again. Together, we are a symphony.

 Don't go. Don’t leave me all alone.

 You're a dummy. How could I? Look within,…

 Even for a moment,…

Kosei and  and you'll find me.

 Like hell would I ever leave you alone. Reach her! Reach her! I'm putting my soul into this! If ever I played with heart, please just let this reach her. Whatever is wrong, fight it and then we can play. Our duet.

 Thank you.

Kosei and Kaori play the duet.

 Wait! Please don't go. Ask me to buy XXX again. Call me out of nowhere to kill time. I don't care if I'm just XXX. Don't go! Please! Please, Kaori. Don't leave me behind.

 Goodbye.

Kaori  Thanks for coming today. Please, take this.

Kaori  You know, you brought a lot of smile in our Kaori's life.

 Gotcha! (Laugh)

 Hey you! I mean, dear Kosei. You were just here and now I'm writing you a letter. Kind of weird, right. You're a mess. You know that? You weak, a quitter and XXX. (Laugh). The first time I ever saw you, I was five years old. It was at a recital for the piano school I went to back then. You march out onto that stage and then made us all laugh by knocking over the bench. You sat at that giant piano and with the first note you played, the world became more colorful. It was like you found a deluxe box of a crank on the keys and toss them everywhere.

Little  I did it. (Smile)

 Suddenly, the girl next to me start falling her eyes out. Now you're gonna give it up? Like you never played in the first place. Hearing you that day, change my life. What do you think of that?

Little  Mummy daddy, it was so good.

Kaori  Woah, look who's home again.

Kaori  You want snacks honey?

Little  Buy me a violin. Please. I want to play violin more than anything.

Kaori  Why do you want to switch instrument?

Little  Cause with violin, I could play a duet with Kosei.

Kaori So I switched. Then and there. No regrets. When I found out we were at the same middle school, I was thrilled. How was I actually supposed to meet you, though? Buy eggs sandwiches every day until you notice me? In the end, all I could do is watch you guys. You were friends, and I was some stranger. It wasn't my place to barge in. So I didn't. I had surgery as a little kid but I never been totally well. After a bad fall on the 7th grade, I was in the hospital a bunch. Those hospital days got longer bit by bit. I was hardly ever at school by then. Nobody said how sick I was exactly, but I knew it was bad. Then one night, I saw my mom and dad crying down in the lounge when they thought I was asleep. That’s when I knew I didn’t have much time. I made a choice, I ran and I didn’t look back. I started living live exactly how I wanted. So I won't be all XXX in heaven. Contact are weird by I try them. I try to eat all cake by myself too because why not? Music that use to boss me around, I played it my way and then I told one single lie. Are you ready for it? Here it comes. Kaori likes Watari.

 Wait. What?

 Shocking right? But I'm glad I told it. After all Kosei, that lie brought us together. Please tell Watari "I'm sorry".

Girl  You sleezze ball. Go to hell you big cheater. I'm done with you.
 I hang out with some other girl. So what? You were busy that day. Remember?

 Honestly though, I'm sure he's moved on to some other girl by now. That's just who he is. When it comes to a friend, he's a great guy, but romantically, I want someone sincere. Also, please tell Tsubaki that I'm sorry. It turns out, I'm was just passing through. I didn't want to leave a big mess behind, so, I couldn't be totally honest with her either. Think of it, "Hey Tsubaki, be a pal and introduce me to Arima, would you? That would be a pretty mess up thing for me to ask for. I mean, everyone could tell that Tsubaki was crazy about you. Even before we were a friend, I knew. The only one who didn't get the memo were you and her.

 Hey (name).

Friend  Yeah

 Go check on Kosei, would you?

Friend  Huh

 Make sure he's eating. Stuff like that.

Friend  No!

 Come on! Now it's not a time to be heartless.

Friend  Not a time to be a chicken either. If you want to know how he is, go check yourself. You're a big girl.

 He was in love with her and now, and now she's gone and Kosei is empty inside. I want to help him but I've had no idea what to do.

Friend  How are you so dumb? If your friend is crying on the floor, you don't run out and buy them a new handkerchief, you give them your sleeves.

 Easy as that huh?

Friend  Listen, I don’t think it has to be some grand gesture. I think it's alright to just be you. For endings like this, you bench your head for a while and let your heart preach.

 How do you get so smart about relationship stuff?

Friend  Boy's love. (Laugh)

 When my life finally brought the two of us together, you were different than I imagined. Stubborn and passive and pessimistic, not to mention the facts that you stole my leggings. Your voice was lower than I thought. You were a guy, you know! And you were gentle, no surprise there. Remember when we jump off that bridge, the river water felt amazing and the moon shining down at the music room like we could grab it on our tip toes. When we race that train, I really thought we could win. Singing twinkle twinkle little start with you late at night felts kind of perfect. Being at school after dark, it's mysterious right? And the snow, it's looks like cheery blossom petals. You must think I'm silly finding wonder in everyday things around us. Things I saw with you.

 Look at you playing it at such XXX. You're growing up kiddo.

Takeshi  You're so cool. Nah. I'm just smiling and blushing because it is a pretty song. That’s all. Falling for my brother rival would be such a douche.

 Isn't it funny how the most unforgettable scene can be so trivial and vice versa.

 None of it was trivial.

 So what's the verdict? Was I able to live inside someone's heart?

 No question.

 and this heart, it wouldn’t happen to be yours, would it?

 You barge in without knocking.

 Do you think that you'll remember me a little from time to time.

 Got no choice. You come back to haunt me.

 No hitting the reset button.

 Not ever.

 Don't you forget me.

Kosei. Hmmm.

 That's a promise, okay?

 Hmmm.

 I'm glad we found each other. Will I reach you? I hope I can. Here's the truth Kosei. I love you! I love you! I love you. Sorry I never eat all the XXX and I that I beat you up so much. I was such a brat to you. I'm sorry for everything. Thank you.

 I can't believe you wrote that. I should thank you for all of it.

 P/S. I'm giving you one of my favorite pictures. You don’t have to keep it. But I'll hope you do.

 hey.

 Uhh. It's you! I mean, hey there! How you've been?

 (Kick Kosei)

 Arghhhh. What the big idea?

 You better not think you're gonna be alone or something. I'm sticking by your side forever and ever like we're cover in superglue. So, you better get used to it.

 Spring time. It's on its way. The season, when we first met. The spring time, without you.
 
Why did you call me out here?
And what is the meaning of this?
Some kind of sick joke? Really?


I was thinking that you'd eat it.
Then you'd do your best in the meet tomorrow.
Urgh!


Have you ever seen my ankle?!
Do you think I can run in the track meet tomorrow?!
Huh...


Sure.


Huh?


After all, it's not like you're severely injured.


What are you talking about?
You've never run in a real race!
Do you even know how fast I was going?!


You might have injured yourself if you were running at full speed.
But I noticed when you fell, your hair wasn't... your hair wasn't tied up.


Uh...


You always tied your hair up when you ran all-out.
Did you plan to trip from the very beginning of the race?


It's better this way.
The upperclassmen were right.
I just happened to run really well while the coach was watching, so she put me on the team.
But I haven't been able to run well ever since.
I keep practicing and trying to, but I can't improve my time.


Huh?


It'd be better if I weren't in the meet.
Why...?
Why can't I run anymore?
I've been practicing so hard.


Don't worry about it so much.
Just run as quickly as your legs will carry you.
If it's ranking that you're worried about, you're already in first place... in my heart and soul.


Ha! Oh...


Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Don't creep me out like that!
Besides, all this happened because of your stupid cheering!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!


Huh...


Uh... Hey.


Hm?


Will you come to cheer me on tomorrow, at the meet?


Uh... Y-Yeah...


Thank you!


Ahh!



Mio Aoyama - 青山 美生
FLAG 3.0  Drive My Car



Katsuragi!
Where are you, Katsuragi?!
How did he find out about this?
I've been ignoring all the invitations.


Miss Mio.
I hope the dress is to your liking.
You see, I took delivery of selecting it myself.


Uhh...
H-He's so cute.
I guess that clothes do make the commoner.
I-I never told you to bring me to this party!


It must be suffocating to spend all your time in that old apartment.
I was thinking that you needed to experience real high-class events occasionally.


Th-That's not what I was talking about!
The party is over there!
This is just the backyard!
You stupid bike-riding chauffeur!
Have you no sense of direction as well as no sense of style?!


Well, I'm not very confident in my dancing ability.
I was hoping you might give me a few pointers first.


Oh, really?
That you're planning to join the party?
You must be joking.
This [glamour] is a very exclusive event for the rich, famous and beautiful only.
I'll have you know I've participated a number of times.


Oh, So you've been here before.


But of course.
I came here with Papa many... um...
Fine.
You can hold a party here by yourself.
Though there won't be any guests, attendants, or chefs.


Good evening.
Would either of you like a drink?


Hey! What's with the flashy designer dress?
You should be wearing something that won't draw attention to yourself!
You're a maid!


Why do I have to be a maid?
I wanna wear a beautiful designer dress!


We aren't here to enjoy ourselves!


Katsuragi!
Don't you want me to teach you to dance?
Come over here.
Hmpf.
I don't have time to waste on the masses so we'll do this in one minute.


Don't ask the impossible.
Huh?


What are you doing?
Give me a hand.
You don't know anything?
Hold my hand!


Never mind.


What is it?


It's... It's just... It's nothing...


Huh?
Holding hands isn't a big deal.
It's a natural part of dancing!


Oh, okay then.


Let's start.
Right, right. Then turn.


Up, down, down, left, right...


You're a quickly study.


Thanks.
Still, this seems like something from a storybook.
And I'm not much for a reader.


An average commoner's observation.
This is typical of high-society life.


A world that has nothing to do with me.


I've danced with Papa so many times at balls just like this.


Huh?

Guy1
Aren't you the Aoyamas' daughter?

Guy2
Miss Mio, what on earth are you doing here?

Guy1
If you're here, you should come inside with us.


I didn't... I didn't want to come here.

Guy2
Then, why are you here?

Guy3
Well, in any case, I was terribly sorry to hear about Director Aoyama.
Miss Mio, I've heard that you're living with your mother in an apartment?

Guy2
Hey, you shouldn't be so rude.

Guy3
I'm sure you're going through a difficult period, so please help yourself to the food inside.

Guy1
Who sent her an invitation?

Guy2
I wouldn't have expected her to show her face.

Guy3
She's probably just here for the food.


Why don't you stop this?
What's the point of all clinging to this lifestyle?


Shut up!
I'm very wealthy, I'm fabulously rich!
And you're damn poor!
Didn't you say that you would help me?!
You're not helping!


You've done enough.
I'm sure that your father is satisfied.
You lived the way your father wanted... to preserve his memory.
That's why you pretended to still be rich and didn't burn incense for your father.
But you should... you should live your own life now and be free.


Papa! Papa!


Mio, you've grown a little.
You should hold your head up, as a member of the Aoyama family, and work hard.


I know!
Because I'm Papa's daughter!


Mio.
Mio.


Papa... Papa is with me here right now in my heart like always.
If I live the way he wanted to, then Papa will never die!


Wait!
Just once you smiled at me.
You never simile at people.
But just once, you looked alive!
I know it's important to respect his wishes.
However, I wanna see you smile more, and be happy.


Yah!


Argh!


Uh...


You're con man!
You pretended to help me, but it was all a trick!
Ever since you showed up, Papa's been getting smaller...
At this rate, Papa will... Papa will really die.


Nevertheless, I want to live in your heart!
If you don't want me, you can return to that world!
You must choose for yourself.
Decide how you will live your life!
This is all up to you.


Papa... Papa...


You've grown up, Mio.


Papa...


Kanon Nakagawa - 中川かのん
FLAG 7.0  Shining Star



There she is!
Kanon.


Keima...


What are you doing?
Don't you have a big concert at hall tonight?


That's right. That's right.
That's right. That's right. That's right.


Are you afraid of becoming invisible again?
Look what's happened.
You became an idol so people would notice you.
Your songs were big hits.
Your fanbase grew.
But then, you were always worried.
If people stopped paying attention to you, stopped praising you, you'd become invisible again.


Th-That's right! That's right!
You really do understand me.
Oh, my gosh!
Keima, thank you.


I-It's just a coincidence.
I happened to run into a similar story... in a game.


Keima, stay by my side!
Give me courage!
Watch me!
You're all I have, all I have!
I can't impress all of those people alone.
I'm going to fail this time.
I am...


Hm?


But if... if you're there for me, I just know that I'll... That I'll... I'll be...


I'm sorry I can't.


Ah...


It's a cop-out.


Cop out?


You need other people to validate your existence?
If that's the case, you'll just become invisible again.


But I... But I...


Stop lying on others!
It isn't necessary!
Your songs... Your singing is fine the way it is.


It is?


You can shine! You can simply shine on your own, Kanon!


I-I can't do it on my own! I...
I can't do anything alone... I can't!


But you already have, Kanon!


Kanon, can you hear the cheers?


Everyone's been drawn here by your light.
I can't keep you... to myself.


Keima...
I would have been willing to sing just for one person alone.
Good-bye.


Shiori Shiomiya - 汐宮 栞
FLAG 11.0  The Last Day



Hey.


Huh?


I would actually prefer for quiet places to not be taken away from me.
You have my support.


Katsuragi...
I said his name without screwing up.


Urgh!


Divine One, are you okay?


Originally, I thought he was being belligerent but now he shows up here.
Who is he?
He's like a character from a fairy tale.


Hmm....


H-Here...


Thank you.


It's a very small homebase.


Mm.


I-If you'd like...


Don't mind me.


He's so rude...
Is he really here to support me?
Should I try talking to him?
But what should I say?
Um... Um...
There's nothing to talk about...
He should say something.
Why do I have to do all the worrying?
Back then, they asked me how I felt about the book, so I did my best to write down my thoughts.
That doesn't work?
If I don't say anything, no one will understand me?
Ah! I spoke out loud again!


No, huh?


Um...


Can I have some please?


Mm-hm, mm-hm.

Ah, the power!
Ahh!


Hehehe.
We turned off the power and reset the password.

Girl1
Wow, the boss is pulling out the stops.

Girl2
You could have just gone to a teacher.


If we bother enough teachers and faculties, the future of the media room might be adversely affected.
A lot of effort went into getting it passed.


Uh!
Heavy...


It'd be pretty tragic if we ended up crushed by books.
The real world is so annoying.
I wish they'd leave me alone, all alone and in peace.


Yes... The real world is scary.
It's a pain to deal with other people.
Katsuragi understands...
I just want to live here forever, in the quiet solitude of the library.


That's a lie.


Uh...


I'm sorry but the truth is you want to talk to others.
That's truth.
But you're frightened... of saying something that makes them hate you.


E-Everybody feels that way, even you, right?


Yeah, so, I don't give a damn about the real world.
Because I... Because I... Because I believe in my world!
What are you trying to protect?
Trying to protect your books?
That it?
Or are you trying to protect your sanctuary from the outside world?


No. I love... I love books.
I don't care about other people.
But I want to talk... to talk about books with other people.
I wanted to talk.
That one time. That other time. That other time.
But it's too late now.
I can't talk to anyone.
Ahhh!
It's impossible... Impossible.
I can't leave this place.
I want to live here forever.
It's scary outside.
People are scary.
Scary. Scary. Scary!
But if I had the courage...
I'm not brave enough.
I can never reach them.
My voice won't reach them...
Won't reach them...
Won't reach them!


I'll give you the courage you need.
[The space shuttle was waiting to launch. Shido and Ririko were speaking at the launching site. Seemingly, it was a situation in the game. Ririko wore space suit so she looked one of the clue members of the space craft]

Ririko:
I don't wanna go to sea yet.
Before the shuttle launch, and I leave this glove, there's something I think I'd like to know about me...

Shido:
What is it, Ririko?

Ririko:
Everyone wanted you to get really good at flirt on Spirits, so you can make them fall in love with you.
I mean, supposed to get better by proxy on me.

Shido:
Yeah, that's the plan.
What about it?

Ririko:
I want, just, I'm afraid...I'm afraid, I might've been falling in love with you...

Shido:
...

Ririko:
It's true, we've known each other forever, you always treated me like little sister...
But, do you think you can start looking at me as an woman instead?

[Choices of yours were displayed on the screen. They were: 1. Of course / 2. I can't do that / 3. Anyway, but I'm not interested in women. ---Shido chose option 1]

Ririko:
This is the best day ever!

[Happily smiling Ririko jumped at and hugged Shido]

Ririko:
Don't you wait about a thing. I'm leaving and waiting from Jupiter. It's like super faraway! Until next time...big brother!

[Ririko tried to kiss to Shido, but the helmet of the space suit she wearing blocked doing it. Anyway, end credit role flew, and the message "CG - mode completed" appeared]

Shido:
AAALLRIGHT!
Ha ha...hah...I rock...

[Real world Shido clenched his fist in triumphant. It looked the time's around early morning]

--- OP ---

Narration:
Spirits, mysterious girls appearing from another world.
Should we fight against their pure strength with the weapons of war?
Or, should we address them with love?
Now, mankind has faced this ultimate decision...

---

[A girl was running through devastated residential area. The area completely burned out, as if a war erupted in there]

Girl:
Dad! Mom!

[She turned the corner, then white haired girl found her parents in middle of the street. Houses behind them were in red flame]

Man:
Origami...!

[She gave back her smile to them. But then, bright light in the sky burst. The light devoured her parents, herself, whole world. Origami woke up]

Origami:
Ah...!

[She didn't wear any cloths. Sweat covered all of her body. She panted heavy breath. It was her nightmare]

---

Reine:
Shin...

Shido:
Yes, Reina...?

[Reine held Shido's head wither both hands. They stood alone in the ill-lighted room. She left her hands after she fingered around Shido's ear. Expectant Shido waited closing his eyes, making up his lip. But that wasn't Reine tried to do. Instead, Shido felt something remained in his right ear]

Kotori:
Are you daydreaming again?
It's time to implement stage two of your training.
So, you better be ready.

Shido:
Huh?

---

[Shido stood at the passage just out of the class 2-4. His teacher, Okamine stood near Shido, too, facing Shido]

Shido:
(This...is training...?)

Okamine:
Good afternoon, Shido?
Is there I can help you with?

Shido:
No...Thank you.

Kotori:
What are you think you're doing?!

[Kotori spoke to Shido through the earphone Reine set up beforehand]

Kotori:
Quit waste everyone's time.
Hurry up, and make her falling love with you!

Shido:
Do I have to?

[In the dark physics preparation room, Shido's voice could heard from the speaker. Kotori and Reine sat at the operation console Reine maintain]

Kotori:
You have to know by now that seducing a Spirit is easier said than done.
If you can't even make a human love you, how do you expect convince a Spirit, too?

Shido:
You asking a wrong guy!
I'm not a stud!

[He whispered to his microphone, hidden from Okamine]

Kotori:
We know.
Start with you compliments and see what happens?
We're hear for response, we'll give you the instruction.

Okamine:
Er...Is there something in your mind?

[Okamine didn't hear Kotori's voice]

Shido:
Mm...Ms. Okamine?
That's a...cute outfit you wearing.

Okamine:
What?
Goodness, you really think so?
Oh my, that was very flattering of you.

[She made her cheek pink. Looked she don't hate what Shido said]

Shido:
Oh yes!
It really does look good!

[Shido stuck up his right thumb]

Shido:
So, does your hair, and...those, sexy glasses.
Perfect shoes...Perfect stockings...Perfect attendance book, heh...

Okamine:
Shido, is everything alright...?

Kotori:
You got way too into that!
Stop it creepy!

Okamine:
I'm kind of busy right now.
So, see you in class?

Shido:
Er...Ugh, er...

Reine:
This can be fixed.
Alright. Listen closely and do exactly as I say.

Shido:
(Sigh) Here's the truth.
I love home room.
I look forward to going toward everyday.

Okamine:
Oh, that's enough I stay here!
I'm so glad you like it!

Shido:
The main reason because I get to see you all the time...
I can't help it!
I think I'm falling love with you.

Okamine:
Oh! Come on, don't say such sweet things!
Honestly, I'm flattered, but students and teachers can't love each other!

[Looked she actually was very flattered. Shido pushed more]

Shido:
No! Don't tell me that!
I'm dead serious...I want to marry you!

[Okamine opened her eyes wide]

Okamine:
You want to MARRY ME~?!

[Pink aura emerged from Okamine's entire body. She lost her senses, grabbed Shido's arms]

Okamine:
Eek! Is it true? Once you old enough to get married I'll be thirty is that OK? You need to meet my parents. Daddy's get so protective and I think he'll like you, he might've even given us the house, once you graduate and get decent job, I can retire and start having babies! Then you---

Reine:
Huh, we underestimated the game easy as that twenty-nine year old single woman.
They make for easy targets...

Kotori:
It'll be annoying if she get's more involved than necessary...
Hey, Shido. We're done here, so make her some excuse, and get out of there pronto.

Shido:
I'm really sorry, Ms. Okamine, I don't think I tried for that hard work commitment!

[Shido ran away by mach speed from Okamine. But Okamine was still in her dream]

Okamine:
You can start out in an apartment and work away, or twin three bedroom condo with a backyard...and don't worry about wedding ready, I've been saving about fifteen years, you can take care the didgy, I'll do the risk! ...

Kotori:
You found a market with older woman.
Good to know.

Shido:
Shut up!
How can you be so calm!
I'm about---Gwah!

[Shido collided other girl student while he was running. Both fell down to the floor]

Shido:
Oh, man...Sorry about that.
...!

[The girl laid on her back. Her leg was open, forming M letter, so her panty was frankly revealed. Nevertheless, the girl quickly regained her proper posture. It was Origami]

Origami:
I'm alright.

Kotori:
Perfect timing!
Why do you practice with her, too!

Shido:
Huh?!

Kotori:
She's around the same age as you, so it'll be natural.
Plus, even she's not a Spirit, she's a member of AST.
Doesn't seem like the type of spreading rumor either.

Shido:
But, rumors about what?

Kotori:
Just talk to her already!

[Kotori yelled at the monitor that showed the corridor where Shido and Origami standing]

Shido:
Urgh...
Er...Hey, Tobiichi.
Those cloths are nice on you.
Where did you get them?

Origami:
It's a uniform.

Kotori:
Come on, Idiot!
You have to put in more effort on that!
Again! With more feeling!

Shido:
(I don't know how...)

Reine:
Shin, follow my lead.

Shido:
To be honest, I already know.
I've known all about you for a quite a while now.

Origami:
I'm aware that.

Shido:
Oh, that's so.
Nice, I'm really glad we're in the same class this semester.
In fact, I'm watching you all the time during the class when you study.

Origami:
Yes. Likewise.

Shido:
Is that so? How random.
I also like sneaking into your locker after school, to sniff your gym cloths.

Origami:
Same here.

Shido:
Okay...I wasn't expecting that.

Origami:
And, why not?

Shido:
Who knew we had so much in common, so do you wanna go out with me?

[Origami stalled. She didn't respond any reaction. Shido spoke to the microphone with whisper]

Shido:
Okay, I'm at a nowhere. Don't you think this is a little sudden?

Origami:
...I wouldn't mind.

Shido:
Er...?!

Origami:
I wouldn't mind that going out with you.

Shido:
Oh...cool! So, you, wanna, like, go somewhere with me? Something like that?

Origami:
Like a movie?
I'm sorry, I assumed that you are asking me out on a date, Shido?
Am I wrong?

Shido:
No, not at all.
That's exactly what I meant.

Origami:
Good.

Shido:
(Getting at...What's exactly what I meant...? How come Reine didn't bay on me out of that one? I'm screwed!)

[Origami handed Shido something]

Shido:
Er...what's this?

[That was a photograph. A portrait of Origami. On the photo, there was a autograph written by Origami herself]

Origami:
For you.
Because you like my uniform.

Shido:
Huh?

[Then, emergency siren was blown]

Announce:
Your attention please. This is not a drill. They have been precursory signs for impending spatial quakes in this vicinity. Please evacuate to near shelter immediately. I repeat...

Origami:
Something's just came up.
Bye.

Shido:
Hey, wait a second!
Where are you going?!

[Origami dashed away from Shido]

Kotori:
A spatial quake is about to happen.
I've left to the Fraxinus for now.

Shido:
Do you think it's a Spirit?

Kotori:
Yes, "Princess."
Should be appearing your exact location.
...Raizen high school.

---

[At the base of the ground force, girls wearing equipment, preparing to encounter the Spirit. All the advertisements and signboards in the city now changed their displaying contents, now all showed warnings of the spatial quake. Walls appeared from under the ground, completely surrounded the school. Under the ground, AST's bullet train stopped for Origami, bring her to its base]

Kusakabe:
They are on their way now!

Origami:
Roger that.

[Origami changed her wear to AST's mech-squad's armor, attacked her back to mechanical wings]

Kusakabe:
Here we go!
The quake has started!

[The space above the high school began deforming, contracting, then burst, swallowed all surrounding material into it. After the spatial quake, half the facility of the school disappeared, as if it was scooped with very large spoon. AST squads stood ready in the woods behind the school premise, waiting for something]

Kotori:
Consider yourself lucky, Shido.
the AST CR units are deadly. They weren't build for indoor combat.

[Now, Kotori sat on the chair of the commander of Fraxinus]

Kotori:
As long as Princess remain inside the school, the AST will have a hard time interfering whatever you do.

Shido:
With what I do?

[Shido stood at the entrance gate of the devastated school]

Kotori:
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

Shido:
...

Kotori:
Relax. This is what you've been training for the past week.
You are as ready as you've ever been.
You wanna save the Spirit, or am I wrong?

[Shido recalled the face of Princess, when she turned to look at him]

Shido:
(She's right. I don't ever wanna see that sad look on her face again...)
Kotori, you're absolutely sure I can do this?

Kotori:
Yes. Just believe in yourself.
You're opposite, and different they dealing on the Spirits, on more intimate method.
Remember that.

Shido:
Be friendly with them, use sweet talk, and make them fall for me.

[Shido stepped forward to the school building]

Kotori:
You're gonna do just fine.
Besides, the Fraxinus has got your back...
We, hold the pride of Ratatoskr, are ready to response to any circumstance!

[Kotori began introduce her clue members. First, it's a tough looking man with a clue cut. He had white mohawk hair)

Kotori:
With five marries, and five divorces under his belt...
The love master!
"Bad Marriage" Kawagoe!

Kawagoe:
Mm~, 'key there!

[Kawagoe gave throwing kiss with his two fingers. His subtitle was "Too early to get boring period". Next man, he looked in early old age, having progressively rearing hair]

Kotori:
It's the working girl's favorite in midnight client...
"CEO" Mikimoto!

Mikimoto:
Who doesn't love love.

[Mikimoto sipped a glass of whiskey. His subtitle was "A president," or CEO. Third, she had a black long hair, sitting with her head down]

Kotori:
Go after this lady's fell in? You'll regret it!
Don't you dare pissed her off!
"Neil Nocker" Shinzaki!

[Her subtitle was "Doll made of straw." She gave a gleaming glance with holding a doll made of straw. Fourth, the man looked usual guy, wearing square shaped, red colored rim glasses]

Kotori:
The man has no fewer than hundred wives!
"Dimension Breaker" Nakatsugawa!

Nakatsugawa:
A-OK!

[He formed a circle using his thumb and index fingers. His subtle was "The man who surpasses the dimension." Fifth and last, she also looked usual woman, having waving chestnut hair, seeing a picture]

Kotori:
Lastly, a woman whose love is so strong...
Not even this, leave a straining order can't keep her away!
"Deep love" Minowa!

Minowa:
...Huh?

[She's too focused on looking a picture she's holding, hardly noticed she got introduced by Kotori. Her subtitle was "Under a probation order."]

Shido:
Fantastic. I'm aligned on perverts...

Reine:
Don't worry, everyone's gotta one they do.

Kotori:
And, that's only a portion of the troops on our side.
Just stay calm.
Even if you died, once you can always stat the new game without a penalty.

Shido:
I'm pretty sure this isn't a game...

Kotori:
Have faith in your little sister...?
Now getting there, flirt!

---

[Shido walked in corridor, arrived at the front of the class room where Princess was. He peeked the room, Princess stood still, alone, seeing outside of the class, the sunset. She turned to Shido. Shido made a gasp. Princess raised her left hand, then slashed down. She blasted a shock wave toward Shido, the impact blew away the building's wall]

Shido:
Whoa!
(Coughing)...Wait just a minute!
I don't wanna fight with you!
Please! Listen to me!

[Shido tried to approach, close a distance, but Princess gave another blast to him]

"Princess":
What's your name?
And, why are you following me?

Shido:
Because...

Kotori:
Don't answer yet!

[Through an earphone which infixed in Shido's right ear. On Fraxinus, busily analyzed the situation]

Minowa:
There has been a change in a mental statement of the Spirit.

Kawagoe:
Reaction analysis complete!

Nakatsugawa:
Displaying choices on screen!

["1. My name is Shido Itsuka, I've come to save you.", "2. I'm just a passerby! Please, don't kill me!", "3. Before asking someone's name, you should give your own." Choices were read out by synthesized voice of Shido]

Kotori:
Well, there they are.
Now, everyone get to work!

[Five clue members, and Reine chose their choice. one people chose choice 1, two people 2, three people chose 3]

Kotori:
No surprise here.
You guys went to the same one I do.

Mikimoto:
The fist choice is a traditional, true classic.
But it doesn't apply a situation.
And it does sound a little cliché.

Kyohei:
Option 2 is also out.
I fear escapes if he can continue the conversation.
Number 3, it is.

Kotori:
I agree. In this case, 3 makes the most sense.
So let him leave he'll get know her better.
'Key, Shido, make up your mind!
Now, listen closely and repeat after me.

"Princess":
What are you waiting for?
Answer the question already!

[Return to the school, irritated Princess questioned Shido]

Shido:
Mmm...

[Shido and Kotori read out the answer in unison]

Shido & Kotori:
Before asking for someone's name...

Shido:
You should really give your own first!

[Another blast attacked Shido. The blast shuttered most of the glass pane of the building story's window. Shido flew to the wall, but looked not so heavily injured]

Kotori:
Well, that was unexpected.

Shido:
What expected my ass!
I could've been dead!

[Shido yelled at the microphone. Princess approached him, making purple glittering electronic ball on her left hand]

"Princess":
No more time for game.
If you do not answer me, I can only assume you are my enemy.

Shido:
My name is Shido Itsuka! I am student of this school! I've got no reason to bite you!

[Shido promptly responded. Princess squinted her eyes]

"Princess":
Hold on...
This isn't the first time we crossed path.

Shido:
No, it's not.
I saw you on the Tenth on the city.

"Princess":
That's right. I thought so...
I remember you saying something on to me that day...

[Princess quit holding energy ball on her hand. Instead, she grabbed Shido's head, and continued questioning on him]

"Princess":
You said, you didn't come to kill me, and that you couldn't kill anyone.
And, now I know that was a lie.
Why else you'd be here?

[Princess stared Shido]

Shido:
Your face...
How come you always look so sad...?

"Princess":
...

Shido:
I'm not trying anything.
And, it's true. I really have no reason to kill you.

"Princess":
Quit lying!
Every single human is out to get me.
I haven't on the thing to them, yet they want me dead!

Shido:
I swear that's not true!

"Princess":
You never answered me...
You claimed to have no intention of killing anyone.
If that's really the truth, tell me why it is you came here?

[Then, another choices appeared on Fraxinus's console. They were "1. Of course, to meet you.", "2. That's not your problem.", "3. It's coincidence. Just happened."]

Kotori:
Oh, first reaction is all that pretty.
This time, option one's probably the safest choice.

[Shido read out option one]

Shido:
I, I wanted to meet you.

"Princess":
To meet me...?
Why would you want that?

[Another choices appeared. "1. I'm interested in you", "2. To have love with you", "3. I'd like ask you about a thing"]

Kotori:
...Do you guys have any ideas?

Kawagoe:
I'll recommend straight forward approach.

Mikimoto:
Yeah. Be clear and direct.
This girl's way too dense to get anything settled.

Kotori:
That's a good point.
We've already waste the enough time answering all these questions...

[So, Shido read out the choice 1]

Shido:
Er, it's simple. I came here because I'm interested in you.

[The "Pincess" sliced down the wall Shido leaned, just above Shido's head]

"Princess":
I'm in no mood to joke around.

Shido:
I know...And, neither am I.
...You wanna know the truth?
I came here so I can talk to you.

["I won't let you make such a sad face." Shido's emotion appeared on the screen]

Shido:
I don't even care what we talk about.
...Not one bit.
You can ignore me if you want to.

["I won't let you make such a sad face."]

Shido:
But, know this.
I'm not like every other human.

["I won't let you make such a sad face."]

Shido:
Because...

Kotori:
Stop it! Wait her signal!

Shido:
Because I'll never let you down!

["Bang." The sound of gun fire resonated in the Spirit's mind. She turned herself back to Shido]

"Princess":
...You said your name was Shido, right?
And, when you said you were interested in me, were you being serious?

Shido:
Yes, I was.

[She turned herself to Shido again, now they were facing each other]

"Princess":
But, like, serious-serious?

Shido:
Serious-serious.

"Princess":
...One hundred percent serious-serious?!

Shido:
One thousand percent serious-serious!

"Princess":
Ummm...!
Jerk! Who was seriously fall for your amateur tricks!
Stupid dummy!

Shido:
But, that was from the heart!

"Princess":
Then, again, this is different.
I don't know what your intentions are...
But, you are the only human I've ever had normal conversation with.
You know this world, which could serve me well.
It might just work...Yup, it's settled.
This should prove your usefulness.

Shido:
Er...Thanks, I guess.
Oh...oh yeah, what was your name again?

"Princess":
My name...?
I've never had any one of those...
But I suppose I will need one if I want to find out why humans so awful...
Okay. Why don't you come up with something you can call me?

Kotori:
Well, she's certainly putting the Fraxinus to work, isn't she?
Alright, clue! We need to pick of her name on the double!

[Every clue on the Fraxinus wrote down names, which they thought best. But, Reine raise a concern]

Reine:
The few suggestions we have aren't gonna be enough.
They want to call in troops from around the world.

Kotori:
One step ahead of you.

[Kotori touched console. Then, smartphones all over the world which installed the game "Fall in love: My little Seed" reacted. Tonomachi, now evacuated in underground shelter noticed a message]

Tonomachi:
Huh? Gosh, now what does she want?

[On the game display there were a message that read "Please, I need a name for my new sister! (Heart)"]

Tonomachi:
Heh heh heh...
Your wish is my command.
My digital darling!

Ai:
Isn't that "that fool" Tonomachi?

Mai:
He's probably sending a dirty text to Shido.

Mei:
That's so lame...

["Tome" was the name Tonomachi gave to her, or system. In Fraxinus, dozen of names were printed on screen. Among them. Also, names that Fraxinus's clue chose showed up on the monitor. The first shown name was "Misako"]

Kotori:
Come on!
Man! We're not naming Princess after one of your ex-wife?!

[The suggestion was made by Kawagoe. Next, the screen showed "麗鐘"]

Kotori:
I don't even know how to pronounce that gibberish!

Mikimoto:
It's "Clarabelle."

Kotori:
The 1920's are over!
Can anyone here think of half way decent girl's name?!
How about, "Tome!"

Shido:
"Tome"...
"Tome" sounds kind a name, right?

[Shido couldn't hide his suppressing smirk. Princess's happiness meter, it was showed on the monitor in Fraxinus, had began tumbling down. She attacked Shido with her dark energy ball]

Kotori:
Wow...She's mad...
Is "Tome" that bad?

[Around Shido, there were countless small hole, such like made by gun shot, around Shido. Shido froze as if he shot by shotgun at point-blank range]

"Princess":
Don't think I can't tell what a human is attempting to make fun of me.
You got it?

Shido:
Okay! Just a minute!
(Apologies to anyone named "Tome." but, I don't think I know a single girl would like that name...Think, Shido! There has to be a perfect name for her...!)

["The comment is just Shido thinking in that way, and it does not reflect any idea of the production committee." The caption explaining the stance of the product team of Date A Live flew on the screen]

Shido:
How about..."Tohka?"

"Princess":
Tohka...yeah, I guess that'll work.

[Shido wrote down her name on the chalkboard]

"Princess":
Is this how it's written?

Shido:
It is.

["Tohka," Princess also wrote down her new name, or scribble it using purple electricity she made on the tip of her index finger, on the chalkboard]

Tohka:
Huh...Tohka.
Now, I have a name.
I think I like it!
Thank you.

Shido:
Yeah...
Yeah, you're welcome.

[Tohka smiled to Shido. Shido stared her smile, thinking]

Shido:
"Tohka" just means "10th" as on a day we met...But, I hates not like she'll ever need to know that!

Kotori:
Get down, and take cover!

[Suddenly, a rain of gun fire fell on Tohka and Shido. From the sky, AST squad delivered a volley of fire]

AST member:
Sure this is OK, captain?

Kusakabe:
We have permission to smoke them out.
Once we've done our job, the enforcement can take care of the rest.

[Tohka's force field hadn't allowed the bullet to reach them, so she and Shido were undamaged]

Shido:
Are you alright?

Tohka:
Hurry up and leave while you still can.
I'd love to continue our talk, but the last thing I want is for you to get hurt.
Don't just stand there. Get going before they open fire.

Shido:
...I'm staying right here!

[Shido sat on the ground, cross-legged]

Shido:
Sit down.
I wanna talk some more.
You wanna know about this world, don't you?
So, have a seat.
Pretend they are not even here.

Tohka:
...Alright.

[She sat near Shido, face-to-face. She's on her knee. AST squad fired a volley again. The noise of gunfire was intense so we can't hear what Shido and Tohka speaking under the force field. But, looks they were chatting merrily each other]

Shido:
I'm curious...If you are not a human, what exactly are you?

Tohka:
I don't know...I don't remember how long ago was I appeared out of nowhere...
That's all I can recall...most of my oldest memories are fuzzy and distorted.
And, honestly I don't know what kind of being I am...

Shido:
That's awful.

Tohka:
I suppose so.
My birth was sudden, and inexplicable.
And, mech-mech-squad was already in the air when I awoke.

Shido:
Mech-mech...huh?

Tohka:
Them.
The noisy flying people...

[Tohka addressed it was AST squad, who were continuing firing their guns]

Shido:
Interesting...

[Then, an earphone Shido wore rang a bell in Shido's ear]

Kotori:
Here's your chance!
Her happiness meter is over seventy!
Now, it is good a time as any to make a move.

Shido:
What do you want me to do?

Kotori:
For starter as you, ask her on a date?

Shido:
...?!

Tohka:
...? What's wrong?

Shido:
Eh, nothing I'm just itchy.

Tohka:
You've been muttering under your breath for a while...
Are you hiding something from me?

[Shido lost his composure. He tried patching up]

Shido:
No, no! You over reacting!

Tohka:
Then, tell me what you were saying just now?

[Tohka generated, held purple electron ball at the top of her index finger, readied to attack Shido]

Shido:
I...forgot?

Kotori:
Come on...cut it the chaste, and ask her out...?
Ask her out! Ask her out!

[All crew members on Fraxinus followed Kotori's repetition]

Fraxinus crew:
Ask her out! Ask her out! Ask her out! Ask her out! ...

Shido:
Alright already!
Shut up, I'll do it!
...Tohka, I wanna ask you something.
Er, but it's...well, it's kind of abrupt.
But...will you go on a date with me?

[In the sky, among AST, Origami continue firing her machine gun. Captain Kusakabe approached to talk to Origami]

Kusakabe:
Have you receive any new orders, Origami?

Origami:
That's negative, ma'am.

Kusakabe:
Even after all this...?

[Then, gun shot broke a part of the building. It made AST members could see Princess was talking with someone, in the rain of gun bullets]

Kusakabe:
Someone was down there with a Spirit!
Hold on! Hold your fire!

[At the time the gun smoke flew away around Princess and her company, Origami immediately recognized who was with the Spirit. She recognized Shido was down there. She contorted her face, activated her light sword, and she nose-dived to attack Tohka]

Kusakabe:
Origami?!
Get back here!

[Down on the building, Tohka and Shido were continuing their conversation]

Tohka:
What exactly was a Date?

Shido:
Er...you don't know?

Kotori:
Look out!
The AST!

[As Kotori warned Shido, Origami, falling from sky, slashed Tohka]

Tohka:
How, rude!

[Tohka blocked Origami's sword by her energy field. Origami landed in front of Shido]

Shido:
What...Tobiichi?!

Origami:
Stand back!

Tohka:
[Well up?], is it you again?

Origami:
He's not your shield!
You scum!

[In Origami's view, She thought Shido was captured by the Spirit]

Shido:
! You've got it all wrong!

Kusakabe:
What are you doing, Origami!
We don't have orders to breaking in on foot!

Tohka:
Sandalphon!

[Tohka stomped the ground by her heel. Then, magic circle was drawn on the ground, and huge scabbard, taller than Tohka, wide as like door, materialized. Seeing it Kotori ordered Shido]

Kotori:
Shido! Get out of there now!
The Fraxinus will come retrieve you.

Shido:
And leave her here alone?

[Tohka pulled out a broad sword, swung. A great impact stormed Origami and Shido]

Tohka:
Um!

[Origami tried to block the shock wave, but she pushed back. Shido was dragged in]

Origami, Shido:
Aaargh!

[The building's wall collapsed, dust smoke rose from the building]

---

Kusakabe:
You could've been killed out there!
Do you realize just how lucky you are she became lost?!

[Captain's reprimand to Origami didn't drown out from noise of the helicopter which about to convey injured Origami's body. The sky had already turned into night]

Kusakabe:
Exercise some restraint, OK?
You're valuable member of AST, so stop acting like it!

[Kusakabe yelled to Origami, who now pulled up by helicopter and leaving from the site]

---

Shido:
(I was there when everything happened.
...Still, the massive destruction just doesn't seem real.
But, yesterday was real...)

[Next morning, Shido stood at the school building alone. School was closed due to destruction on last day. Shido stared the piece that once the part of blackboard hung on the class room. A scribbled name "Tohka" remained on it. Shido found the piece, and picked up it]

Shido:
(It wasn't a dream at all...)

Tohka:
Shido!

Shido:
(That's right. I really did talk with Tohka, and gave her a name...Crazy)

[Shido felt he heard Tohka's voice]

Tohka:
Hey, Shido...
Quit ignoring me!

[It's not he imagined. Shido tuned back, and he looked Tohka standing on a pile of crumbled concrete blocks]

Shido:
Tohka!

Tohka:
You just now noticed me?
Well, you are so dumb!

Shido:
But, how did you wind-up back over here?
The spatial alarm didn't even go on!

Tohka:
Why would it?
You were the one who invited me back!
For a...date, I think?

Shido:
Er...

Tohka:
Well, guess what?
It's time for that date!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

Shido:
Okay! Just bring it down a bit!
And, you should probably get out that first...
Do you mind changing?

[Shido pointed at Tohka's costume, a purple armor she wearing]

Tohka:
Right now?
You want me to undress in broad daylight?

Shido:
No! Oh, that's not it!
Er...Ah!
Let me show one example.

[Shido showed a photograph to her. Origami was displayed, and she was wearing school uniform]

Tohka:
You think this outfit is better...?
...Why are you walking around with this picture?

Shido:
Quit asking question.
Just change already.

Tohka:
Very well...

[Tohka split the portrait of Origami in two, and dumped it. Then she raised her right hand, and instantly, she changed her cloths into the same school uniform Origami wore. Her dark purple straight hair tied up with red ribbon, the same kind of string she tied around her neck]

Tohka:
How does this look?

Shido:
Um...good.

Tohka:
Glad you think so.
Time for a date!

--- END ---

Shido:
Hey! Stop walking so fast!

Tohka:
You're too slow, Shido!
Date time, date time!

Shido:
Oh, sure!
Just announced to the entire world!

[They were stepping aside the road which was packed by running ground force's vehicles]
Jormungand>02.Pulsar
Koko: Damn it! I can’t get through to them. Is this signal being jammed!?
Don’t say “maybe!” “Maybe” doesn't cut it! Identify the problem now!
Lutz: Look out world, the little ladies pissed off again.
Koko: Those idiots at HQ were useless. I'm so sick of this shit!
How are we going to meet up with Valmet and Tojo if I can't reach them?
And something else I want to know… Who are those guys?

Lehm: That's one of the border police is right. How do we play it?
Koko: Don’t bother stopping. If they want to pit an LAV against a twenty-ton truck…
Wiley: === Damn!
Lutz: What are you doing!? Get back here!
Koko: What the hell is this!!!

Lehm: They’re fighting for that pipeline.
We landed ourselves smack in the middle of a live battlefield.
But, hey, at least that explains why the phone wasn't working, right?
Check it out. We got GMS mobile phone base stations, relay towers and microwave transmissions site.
All blown up by whoever got there first.
Crap like this goes down both sides want to control information which is what I meant about the satphone covert war equals total blackout.
Koko: You know an awful lot about this, Lehm.
Lehm: I guess.

Soldier: We got eyes on two heavy load trucks and a squad equipped with small arms, bodyguards most likely.
And a woman having some kind of seizure.
Pollack: That’s our dealer. Don’t fire.
Koko: It’s alright, boys. We’re not the enemy. That doesn't make us friends though.

Pollack: I’m glad you could make it, Miss Hekmatyar. It’s a pleasure.
I must say you're a lot younger than I expected.
Koko: Nice to meet you, Major Pollack.
Pollack: Sorry if my men were a little rough. They're kind of on edge.
I’m glad to see all eight anti-aircraft missiles made it as we agreed.
Koko: Of course, Major. Now if you would just sign…
Pollack: There’s no need to rush, is there? Go on, pull up the chair.
Koko: So, tell me. When did the shit hit the fan?
Pollack: Just eight hours ago.
Koko: I thought lieutenant colonel Grant was taking this delivery.
Pollack: Well, things change. Not everyone has the stomach for this kind of fighting.
So, let’s just forget all about the lieutenant colonel.
Koko: Damn… This is going to get ugly... Soon, very ugly.
Things are volatile enough here already and now this guy wants even more weapons.
They'll never be satisfied. Wait for it?
Pollack: Here you go. The order’s complete. But there may be something else you can do for me.
Koko: There it is.
Mildo: Koko? I thought that was you. Hey girl, long time no see.
Koko: Mildo! And Lu’s with you.
Mildo: Hey, where’s Valmet hiding?
Koko: She's not with us on this run, but with the two of you here, that's got to mean…
Curry: Well, Koko Hekmatyar, what a coincidence.
Koko: President Curry of England’s CCAT. Coincidence my ass.

Jonah: Help with you something?
Mildo: Oh, this charming === is a new recruit? (laugh) That’s classic.

Koko: What's Mr. Curry have for you?
Pollack: Stinger missiles.
Curry: New warheads with refurbished launchers.
We acquire them from suppliers in eastern Europe.
Once they’re operational, we’ll get to watch this attack heli’s drop like mosquitoes just like the good old days.
Koko: (Right. He's getting out of here as soon as he can.)
Curry: They’re powerful plentiful and inexpensive. Precisely, the kind of goods are customers look for.
Koko: Well, =this has been riveting.=
But now that our contract has been fulfilled. We’ll be...
Pollack: We are not done! I need something else.
Koko: What’s that?
Pollack: A new rader unit. My radar site was taken out in an air raid.
I need a battlefield radar to replace it.
Curry: Ahh… Something of that size is beyond my capabilities.
Koko: That's not the kind of thing I carry with me.
Curry: But surely you can get one.
You of all people, your own father, Mr. Floyd Hekmatyar, is a navy giant.
And it's no secret that a sizable chunk of HCLI’s naval weapons sales in Europe and Africa is personally overseen by you.
You don’t expect us to believe you can’t get hold of a simple rader unit.
Koko: (You old fart. Don't think I can't see what you're doing.)
Koko: Nope! Not happening. Too bad. so sad. ===.
Mildo: ===.
Pollack: You're not leaving yet, white man!
Lutz: You have your answer. Now tell your guys to back the hell off!
Koko: Lutz! Enough!
Koko: Let's all settle down. No reason this has to go all Tarantino.
I've underestimated you, Major Pollack, your face here than you look.
You’ve orchestrated an information blackout.
I'll bet your infantry even has orders to kill any civilian or journalist he tries to flee over the pass.
You're desperate to keep this battle for the pipeline a secret. You intend to keep it for yourself.
Pollack: You make it sound so insidious when you put it that way.
You're right about one thing though.
A soldier does earn his paycheck by killing people.
And as it happens, my soldiers are very well paid.
They have a job to do, and it's my task to get the materials they need to do that job.
You can and will get me what I need. That is not a request.
Now, you go see about getting my radar unit. I've got some things to take care of.
Of course, she'll be well compensated when this is over.
Mildo: That was a close one =love,= but I guess the storms passed, yeah?
Curry: Goodness. Prickly fellow and dangerous too, I'd wager.
Koko: He's nothing. Why don't you run along home now?
Mildo: Ta.

Lehm: So… Where do we go from here?
Koko: We’ve got an order to fill.
Koko: (We’re running for it! Pretend we accepted this offer!)
Koko’s Squad: Ahh.

Koko: We need to locate Valmet and Tojo.
According to my intel, this army is just about out of funds.
He never come right out and say it, but it's pretty clear he only intends to pay up if his side wins.
I am not a bank! I’m Koko Hekmatyar! I never === will accept credit!


Valmet: I don’t like this. Koko's instructions were to wait for her in the other side that pass.
Tojo: What were we supposed to do. it's not our fault. Those guys decided to raid the area.
Man, =the sunset and= they're still going at it. That's dedication.
Valmet: Dedication? More like stupidity. Rank amateurs.
Tojo: Oh, somebody's in a mood, huh? If you want, we can do a quick check on the pass in the morning. That all right?
Valmet: Fine by me.
Tojo: And hey, at least we found a place =that charger= cells.
Valmet: Yeah, the spot isn't so bad... Kind of nice. Sleeping under the stars.


Pollack: You want to contact HCLI headquarters.
Your cells will have reception again once you cross the pass.
Even at precious iridium phone of yours isn't working here, is it?
Just so happens this is one of the only places in all of Europe out of its range.
Koko: I'm impressed you knew I had a satphone on me. But yeah, still out of range.
Pollack: I'll have two of my elite soldiers accompany you as long as you've got them along you should make it through the pass safe enough.
Koko: (Guard dogs.)
Pollack: Take care. I could be treacherous.
Oh, and if you try to pull anything stupid, I will kill you.


Soldier: (tsk) You think you're real bad ass, don't you?
Koko: (Really? 10 minutes and you're already talking smack?)
Soldier: People like you make me sick. How many deaths are you responsible for.
Guess whatever fancy college you went to did not offer a class on ethics.
Koko: You don't know what you're talking about, I'm just a merchant.
I never went to anything resembling school let alone a fancy college.
Despite my lack of formal education, however,
I know more about weapons in a shithead like you can ever hope to in a lifetime,
which is unfortunate.
Because I find it very depressing to hand my quality merchandise over to soldiers not worthy of wielding BB guns.
And now you've pissed me off. So you might want to stop talking.
Soldier: What did you say you little…

Soldier: This is Orin pass.
Koko: Uh… So foggy.
We might finally be able to get through to someone though.
You do it. Try calling Valmet and Tojo.
Jonah: It’s ringing.
Koko: We’ve got reception. Awesome!

Koko: Those are Mi-24V Hind Es out there. They’re Russian Army copters.
Everyone, take cover! Get away from the car!
Koko: (What's their target? Is the mountain infantry nearby? A stinger? looks like it missed.)

Soldier: Who the hell are you?
Koko: Major Pollack’s arms dealer. Are you a part of the unit firing the stingers?
Soldier: I'm not going to tell you that.
Koko: There is good as dead. Get your men away from the Hines.
Those things are designed to hunt people. Look at the sensor pod.
The normal low-light-level TV Ladoga F has been modified by an Eastern European third-party with a thermal sensor.
If he wanted to, the pilot could easily pick up on our heat signatures.

Koko: That was a close one.
Soldier: (This chick hasn't stopped smiling the entire time. She's nuts!)
Soldier: You were lucky this time. And get out of here!
Koko: I was planning to.
Jonah: Why not just go ahead and sell him what he wants.
Koko: My gut? This battle will be short. Two days at the absolute most.
In the end, no one will really win.
Russia is already full of these skirmishes and its major has a lot more ambition than he can afford will be plenty of fights just like this one over the next few years.
None of them will be decisive, and no fashion will gain control of that pipeline, and it's liquid gold.
Plenty of dealers will see this mess and start salivating.
Ready to sell weapons left and right. Most of them in fact.
That's not how I operate and so we have no further business on this battlefield.
Jonah: Are basing this all on your gut?
Koko: Yes, being a part of this team means trusting my intuition. Think you can handle that?


Soldier: Sun of a bitch!
Curry: Fuck! Mildo! What the bloody hell were you thinking?
Mildo: Uhh… It was pissing me off. Elite soldiers my ass.
That whining was getting on my last nerve.
Curry: Did it even occur to you and your infinite stupidity that the major sent them along as ID to get us through the pass.
My entire plan is in shambles because you were getting annoyed.
That trigger-happy bitch! Let me see the map.
Mildo: Nothing fazes him for long. I like that in a boss.


Soldier: Who the hell are you talking to?
Koko: I’m confirming with HQ where we’re supposed to pick up the goods.
Valmet: What should we do with them?
Koko: Nothing === for now.
Koko: Tie them up. Good. Oh, and gag that one. He pisses me off a lot!
Koko: It’s about time. I was freaking worried.
Valmet: I was worried about you too, Koko.
Valmet: (Oh! I can die happy right now!)
Koko: OK. We got everyone. Let's get moving!
Valmet: (Oops, nosebleed.)


Lehm: Well, look what we got here. Put it down, Lu.
Hey, it's just our friends from CCAT. It's all good. We’re clear for entering.
Lu: No, actually it’s not all good.

Koko: Well, Mr. Curry, fancy running into you here. What a coincidence.
Thought you'd be well on your way back to Jolly Old England by now.
Mildo: Been a while yeah?
Valmet: I guess.
Mildo: Do you have any idea of fascinating I find you, I mean, one eyed woman soldier?
Just the thought of you fighting is that knife makes me shiver. What do you say you want to have a go?
Valmet: I think I'm going to pass. So sorry.
Mildo: Mr. Curry!
Curry: Shut up! You've done enough already. Just sit still.
Mildo: I don’t know how.
Curry: Did you kill the guard dogs that major sent with you?
Koko: No. Tying them up with sufficient enough.
Curry: Well, that stupid woman killed ours. Once he knows, he's likely to send guys after us.
Koko: More than likely.
Curry: Why don't we send out a couple of scouts to be safe.
Koko: I’m so sorry, Valmet. Do you mind?
Valmet: No prob.


Valmet: Well, it looks like you get your wish. I can't say “No” to Koko.
Mildo: She's changed, hasn’t she?
I’m in the last time I saw her, she was amazing.
And now, she is even more amazing.
Valmet: Koko was the best then and she still is.
Mildo: Let’s play!

Mildo: It's nice to see you haven't lost your edge.
Not that I ever thought you would. I can’t touch you.
You’d expect === your three disadvantage === knife fight === not.
I thought the dark might even the playing field === this time.
See I got great night vision but I’m still losing, damn you!

Mildo: Uuh...
Valmet: Hard to believe that your movement seem even stiffer than the last time, Mildo.
I love a good knife more than anyone so I get why you want to carry so many.
Weighing yourself down with that makes you clumsy. Even Jonah are new recruits said you were covered with “the damn thing.”
Mildo: (Jonah… So that’s the kid’s name.)
Valmet: You threw this knife thinking even === back over here and I claiming.
You’d make a grab for it once my back was turned or something.
Was that the plan?
So how did that work out for you.
Mildo: Ahh...
Valmet: What are you whining about?
Once a weapon is left your hand, it's gone for good.
Only an idiot would rely on getting it back.
Mildo: Fuck now she’s a === mode.


Pollack: The group of 10 is Koko Hekmatyar and her Hired Guns.
The group of 3 is Curry and his lackeys.
Koko’s group should be a priority. I want them taken care of.
Be quick about it though.
Don't forget that while you're dealing with them, Orin pass and the freeway will be vulnerable to attack.
Soldier A: Roger that, Major.
Soldier B: I don't like this. It was the other group that killed our man.
Soldier B: I’m aware of that, thank you.


Valmet: You may want to adjust your line of thinking Mildo.
You are carrying on earlier about your fascination with me.
But I warn you I am not someone you want to get close to.
Mildo: Oh, come on. Your story’s as cold as it gets. =And elite you and= soldier betrayed by her own and stripped of everything?
But you got back on your feet and trained your ass off until you're even better than before.
Valmet: I don't really give a shit about you but I will offer this piece of advice.
Great expectations only leave the great disappointment.
Mildo: Expectations? I gave up on those a while ago.
People who do what we do learn early not to expect much from this ugly empty world because we’re empty too.
Maybe it starts the first time we hold a weapon or the first time we kill someone.
We tell ourselves it’s to protect our family or our country but it doesn't take long to realize that’s bullshit.
So no, I don’t expect much. I just think that beating you would make life a little less empty.
Valmet: Idiot.
Mildo: Alright, you’re off the hook for now. But next time your ass is mine.
Valmet: I take it you’ve detected scouts nearby. How far?
Mildo: 500 meters. Ta.
Valmet: Good catch. At least the poor girl is good for something.


Koko: Guns up get ready kids!
Koko: We’ll go first and then establish an escape route.
Depending on what we're up against we may be able to subdue them.
I guess I'll let you owe me one this time.
Curry: I see you are brave and generous as ever Miss Hekmatyar.
Koko: Naturally. Later, Mildo!

---

Lehm: There aren't very many but they have surrounded.
Koko: On my command squad. Lower your weapons!
Mildo: Hahaha.
Curry: What the…
Koko: Now remove your clips and fold the stocks!
Pollack’s man, listen up! You don’t want us! The ones who killed your pals are in there!
Curry: ===
Curry: Damn it! Damn it!

Soldier: Looks like we'll be away from our post for a little while.
Probably wouldn't be too hard for someone to slip through the border in heading North.
This kind of stunt only works once, lucky girl.

Koko: Step lively everyone! I want the hell out of this killing field!
Jonah: … Hahaha.
Lehm: =Some amuse,= Jonah? What?
Jonah: Nothing. Just feels kind of weird ===. Never left the battlefield without firing my weapon before.
Koko: Sorry, will you feel better if I let you shoot a whole bunch next time?
R: === carefull Jonah.
You going to figure out real quick she's only half joking when she said stuff like that.
Can’t help it. She’s an arms dealer.


Pollack: Both sides were able to escape. impressive.
But unfortunate, … blame you? No, not at all.
I understand your actions and I'll stand by them.
I'm here to take responsibility. That's my job.
It’s over and done now. Return to your post. (hang up the phone)
it is no coincidence here raids stop the second this arrived.
May as well be a pile of scrap metal for all the good it's going to do me now.
Just my luck worked out for her though.
That woman is a === psycho.

Koko: I knew 2 days was generous.
Officer: Man?
Koko: Uh, sorry… Nothing.
Officer: Have a nice trip.
Koko: Thanks. I will.

Curry: We made it.
Mildo: I’m so tired.
Koko: Hah, look who survived.
MAOU: What's this?
ASHIYA: Vegetables, Sire. I suppose this is her way of saying thank you. Allow me to ascertain the safety for you.
MAOU: Is it good?
ASHIYA: Yes, Sire. It's quite good! ...Eh? That's unusual. Why is our key on the floor?
MAOU: I'm guessing she opened the window on a way out, lock the door from the outside, and tossed the key back in.
ASHIYA: Ah, typical hero...All exemplary in a conduct.
MAOU: What would you have done is you were her?
ASHIYA: Isn't it obvious? First, I would've locked the door. And then, I would've taken the key with me.
MAOU: Typical demon...
ASHIYA: Would you have me any other way, Sire?
--- OP ---
EMI: Feel also violated...! News Caster: And other news. Multiple shots were fired in the Shibuya area before dawn this morning. The area was littered with numerous bullet holes. And, abandoned bicycle hit multiple times with found at the scene of the crime---
EMI: Unbelievable! This jerkwad! Well, it's not my problem...
NEWS CASTER: Police believe it's related to the shooting, and they're doing everything they can to track down the owner. Police are also investigating possible links between this incidents and recent string of late night muggings and store front robberies. Although, the exact major the connection remains unclear---
CHIHO'S MOTHER: That's hop-skip-jump from here. Darling, isn't that really close to where you work?
NEWS CASTER: Moving on then, a minor earthquake had registered in the Kanto region, at approximately 6:20 this morning.
---
CHIHO: "I'm not joking or imagining things. I'm really thinking the earthquake is coming. So, if you don't mind, could I ask your advise about this in person?" Er...And, send...!
MAOU: "Okay. Does tomorrow evening work? I've got the day off. And, you're not on shift either, are you?"
---
CHIHO: Hmm...
CHIHO'S MOTHER: Chiho, are you working today?
CHIHO: (cough) Eh? No, I'm not. But I am really busy today, you know, whit lots of other stuff!
CHIHO'S MOTHER: You just be safe out there.
CHIHO: Why wouldn't I be? "Safe?" Huh. That's my middle name!
CHIHO'S MOTHER: This neighborhood's not like it's used to be.
CHIHO: Yeah, I know, mom.
CHIHO'S MOTHER: What is the matter with you...?
CHIHO: Um, nothing. I'm fine.
CHIHO'S MOTHER: Chiho?
---
RIKA: Emi, you heard about the shooting, yeah? Wasn't that pretty close where you live?
EMI: No, I'm like three stops from there.
RIKA: That's crazy. Anyway, what are you doing for lunch? Wanna head that curry place I told you about? Yes, there'll be a line, but it is toll [???]
EMI: Eh...Thanks, but I'm way too busy to stand in line today. Plus, I lost my wallet.
RIKA: What? That sucks!
EMI: And now I have to fill out a bunch of forms on my break. Ah...Thank you for your call today. I'm Emi Yusa. How can I help you?
???: Yusa...Sounds to me like fitting and quite nicely, Emilia the Hero.
EMI: ! ...May I ask who is calling?
???: Someone who knows about the hero and the Devil. And, that's not all. I'm gonna do everything with my power to destroy you both.
EMI: Understood, sir. I'll do whatever it takes to keep that from happening.
???: I doubt to admit, I didn't expect you two to join forces.
EMI: That was not our company's desired result either.
???: I guess, not. Either way, King Satan will be taken out. As well Emilia the Hero...It's Ente Isla's will.
EMI: ! Is that right?! ...Eh. I'm afraid we won't have any specifics. We don't have a chance to investigate the situation.
???: The Devil and the hero, running away from little gunfire. That's situation. And, how are you done to investigate?
EMI: A vile tone that seems to echo from the pits of darkness...He's a demon... Alciel is the only reputable general still working among us...so that would make you...nothing. If you think you can scare me with words like "Ente Isla's will," you're dead wrong. I don't listen to idol threats from nobody as like you.
???: When this is all set and done, I guarantee you'll be singing in the different tune.
EMI: ...Um? Takes all kinds, huh?
---
EMI: Hey, so how about that curry place? I remember that how busy the bank is during lunch. Eh? ...Yeah, hello?
MAN: Hello there, I'm trying to get in touch with Miss Emi Yusa?
EMI: Yes, that's me.
MAN: I'm calling from the Yoyogi police station.
EMI: Heh? ...The Police?
---
EMI: Gwhaaa...! ...Gah!
MAOU: Then, think there was a snowball's chance and home data ID us from that bike...these cops are good.
ASHIYA: Well, we were definitely right about one thing. Regarding her age, the hero fudge the truth. If I remember correctly, she's only about seventeen or eighteen.
MAOU: Yeah, I told you that. But, she must've registered this being at least twenty. No idea why, though. I thought women lied about their age to appear younger.
ASHIYA: I don't understand why fudge means lie.
EMI: Gah! Who the crap cares about that?! Why me?! I wanna know! 'Cause I'm little confused! I'M A HERO! SO PLEASE TELL ME WHY I JUST SUPPORT BAIL FOR A COUPLE OF ASS, MY GOOD FOR NOTHING DEMON?!
MAOU: ...Dude! Would you please calm down? I'm sorry, but we couldn't think of anybody else.
ASHIYA: We weren't positively overjoyed about asking for your help either, but we had no choice.
EMI: Well, I'm for one never thought I have to use my seal and ID card for something that just so DAMN!
MAOU: I suppose I could've asked my manager at work to help us out at first...
ASHIYA: We can't annoy your boss for such trifles.
EMI: So you annoy me instead?!
MAOU: Well, dah. 'Causing trouble for hero is the whole point of being a devil.
EMI: Oh...you win. Can't argue with that logic...
MAOU: Don't be mad. We let you stay in our place.
EMI: Ugg...
ASHIYA: Emi, relax. Heroes aren't supposed to have nervous break down.
EMI: Yeah?! That's 'cause I never make you, jerks! You fridge is completely empty! Put a little more thought into your grocery list next time! You are Demon General and you don't even know how to shot!
ASHIYA: I'm on a diet! ...I-I'm watching my calories!
EMI: Just so you know, I gotta threatening phone call at work today, and that wasn't very pleasant. They are after you two, Maou. Mr. King Satan himself.
MAOU: Thanks for the head up.
EMI: I was just a head up. So, don't get the wrong idea, I'm still going to be the one to take you down. And, don't you forget it.
MAOU: Just your remind. We're in public, so stop acting like a psycho.
EMI: Ugg...! You suck! Just make sure you don't get murdered by some loser nobody before I get the chance to kill you first!
MAOU: They're after both of us, huh...And they called at work of all things...Eh? Haa...
ASHIYA: It's a diet and workout place...
MAOU: Oh, get a crap, really! Nobody cares about your stupid exercise routine!
---
CHIHO: I'm home! ...Hmm!
---
ASHIYA: To clarify, what time are you meeting miss Sasaki? Where are you meeting her? And, When can I expect you back?
MAOU: What? Are you my mom now? Five o'clock, Shinjuku station.
ASHIYA: We do have a better time to spare then. In that case, Sire, you and I must go.
MAOU: Wait, go where?
---
ASHIYA: Oh yes. Quite fabulous.
MAOU: Whatever, where did you get the money to pay for this stuff anyway?
ASHIYA: Naturally, I've set aside the secret stash of savings for just a sort of emergency.
MAOU: Emergency? I'm just gonna sit there, hear her out, and come home. I don't think this is necessary.
ASHIYA: Oh, contrary, Sire! Do you not see a fragile teen-age girl never divulge as deep as fears to anyone but closest confidence! And, that's you! Did she, or did she not reveal it to you, surely you cannot be blind to such a disclosure means!
MAOU: Yah! Okay! Would you just chill out?!
ASHIYA: And besides, there is no way I arrow you to go on a date dress like some dirty transient bum.
MAOU: Ouch...why so harsh?! I do not dress like a transient bum, and you will take that back!
---
CHIHO: ...Got this!
---
CHIHO: Ah, there you are!
MAOU: Hey Chi. Oh, wow, that is new haircut?
CHIHO: Glad you notice! Yeah, it's short. So what do you think?
MAOU: Er...looks good.
CHIHO: Score! I like your outfit. I don't think I've ever seen you are cleaned up like this!
MAOU: Er?
CHIHO: Oh...not to say you look that before...you always look good...it just now, you're better is all. Er, all I did mean...better. What I mean is...you look so cool.
MAOU: Yeah, my roommate told me I need to dress a little nicer for our date.
CHIHO: Wow, so you're saying you to think this is a date?
MAOU: Er...I guess so, yeah.
CHIHO: Score!
MAOU: So, what now?
CHIHO: There's a great cafe not too far from here. It's cheap and pretty laid-back, too. You'll love it! And, since you're giving me an advice, it'll be my treat! Does it sound like a good plan?
MAOU: I can't let you do that. I mean, thank you. But I can't accept. This lunches on me.
CHIHO: Eh, Mr. Maou?
MAOU: Hmm?
CHIHO: You see...the thing is...
MAOU: What's up? Are you all right?
CHIHO: Yeah...just, wanted to hold your hand...
MAOU: Oh, that's all? Yeah, no problem.
CHIHO: Ah!
MAOU: You okay?
CHIHO: Huh? Y-yeah, I'm great! Never better, actually. Thank you for asking, though.
MAOU: This way, making our way through the crowd, we won't get separated.
CHIHO: You're right, that's true. That I say even sorry, I suppose. Nn-fu-fu...
---
EMI: Er...Um? ...What's sort of no good are you up to?
ASHIYA: Gya?! Emilia?! 'Tis you?!
EMI: Don't use my real name! You realize how creepy and suspicious you're acting right now, don't you? What are you doing? Tailing somebody?
ASHIYA: Ngh...No. I mean, it's none of your business!
EMI: I'm a hero, so it is my business when I see you behaving like some creeps or weirdo, isn't it?
ASHIYA: Yeah, I guess so...? Drop it just as once for me?
EMI: You've gotta be kidding me. I knew you were. You were a demon, and have you forgotten?
ASHIYA: Ahh!
EMI: Ugh...!
ASHIYA: Oh, curses...I've really done it this time, haven't I, Sire...?
EMI: You scumbag...Ass face! What are you planning to do that girl?! Tell me!
ASHIYA: You felt it wrong! His majesty's intentions are nothing but pure I can assure you!
Emi: He's a devil! I seriously doubt he knows what pure is!
ASHIYA: I beg you! Listen to what I have to say!
EMI: ...Well, that's unexpected.
ASHIYA: So, you understand me now?
EMI: If you mean, do I understand? But his majesty's as much as you know what is ever, then yes. But, what I don't understand is why they need to go on a date?
ASHIYA: I wondered the same thing initially...But it's clear to me after observing her, that this Sasaki girl is more than just a little fond of your old rival.
EMI: It seems so...
ASHIYA: Um...I'm sorry that doesn't bother you at all?
EMI: You want it, too?
ASHIYA: Wh...No, I---I just find extremely unbearable in highly insolent that mere human girl has become so enamored of my King!
EMI: Personally, I'm surprised to girl that cute waste her time with a no good, very bad miscreate like your King.
ASHIYA: You dare insult his majesty so?!
EMI: Of course I do. Anyway, from the girl's point of view. At least pretty obvious she's into him. The trendy little dress she just bought, brand new hairdo fresh from the salon, and those boots are new, too...
ASHIYA: Oh? How can you tell?
EMI: Well, it's not so apparent to a man, I guess...Her dress is screaming "I'm young and available!" and form fitting cut is emphasize her...DUMB THOSE ARE HUGE!
ASHIYA: What a huge?
EMI: Nothing! Pervert! I said nothing! Besides, they're going to get in your way when you're fighting and battle! Small ones mean small armor, which saves money! And mean less constricted in your movement!
ASHIYA: I think you've lost me.
EMI: Just forget it! Back to the matter at hand! Do you think he can get anything useful out of her?
ASHIYA: Don't ask me. I'm only trailing the event that any undesirable to decide to show up.
EMI: You're here, so you failed by default. Still...this whole earthquake thing's definitely a cause for concern. One thing I know for sure, I'm not going to sit here to find out a hard way...Not really any point in spying on from out here. Follow me in.
ASHIYA: Follow you in where?
EMI: To get a table! Now, you're in coming or not?
ASHIYA: W-wait a second! How could I expect his majesty to excuse such extreme audacity?! No! Stop right there!
---
MAOU: Maybe...you could just go over the details just one more time, please?
CHIHO: Yeah, sure. I told you how my tinnitus got really bad, didn't I? It happened right around the time I started working at MgRonald's. At first, I thought I was just tired for doing a bunch of work I wasn't used to. But then, last night...
---
???: (Hello, can you hear me? Can you hear me?)
CHIHO: Someone there? Hello?
???: (Can you hear me?)
CHIHO: Hello?
???: (No good, Huh? I guess they cannot hear me)
CHIHO: Hey, I can hear you.
???: (Oh, well...Not too many people have the reception for it...)
CHIHO: ...What the heck?
???: (I am sure disturbances are happening in your world right now. A big one might be coming any moment not, so watch out)
CHIHO: Why? A big one...?
???: (I will come there soon, when the time is right)
---
CHIHO: Not only could hear what he said, but I understood him. So, you can see why I'm confused...?
MAOU: Yeah...and because of the quakes we had lately, you assume there are the disturbances you referring to.
CHIHO: Yeah.
MAOU: The idea link...A method of communication where being and different world, tune their minds to each other with sharing impressions and concepts... They're able to transfer these ideas across time and space by utilizing sonar probe technology. When the signal reaches to desired target and causes a magical explosion, creates various phenomena. In this case, these pulses could have easily caused those recent earthquakes. And if that's true, given the number of quakes we've had, the only possible explanation is that somebody's dead set on tracking down me and Emilia...A big one is coming soon indeed. Things are happening faster I expecte----Bwaha!
CHIHO: What's the matter, Mr. Maou?! Are you all right?!
MAOU: Oh, come on...! What is Emi doing, walk in here with Ashiya...?!
CHIHO: What's wrong...?
MAOU: Nothing! I...haven't done anything wrong.
CHIHO: Huh?
MAOU: So anyway...To wrap this up, the tinnitus and weird voices you've been hearing aren't really a cause for the concern, so don't worry about that. Heh...The real issue is whether or not the big one is actually coming. And, assuming that it is, I think simply being able to warn the people around you, will make big difference, don't you?
CHIHO: I'm glad I told up that note actually ask you about this, I feel a million times better already!
MAOU: Hear that, Emi? I'm doing a good thing here! Anyone can see I'm just trying to help this girl out.
CHIHO: ---Can't tell my parents about it, or school friends either. That's why, w-well, I guess I knew you'd be the only one who believe me. You're kind...and, so gentle...I love talking to you. See...thing is...you're, real nice and, er...I, er...Well, Mr. Maou, I li---
EMI: That's enough!
MAOU & CHIHO: Eh?!
EMI: I hope you know you're conversing with the worst being in the world.
MAOU: Please, not now...
EMI: Trust me, little girl. This one is not what he seems. He's cruel, cunning, stupid...
CHIHO: Hey now! Don't pop out of nowhere and start saying hateful things like that! [That's about ??? can be?! ?] Who are you to him anyway?!
EMI: I'm his arch-enemy. Look, take it through someone who knows, he sucks. Nothing good will come from knowing him.
MAOU: Emi, cut it out.
EMI: Never tell me what to do.
MAOU: You need to calm down too, Chi.
CHIHO: No, Mr. Maou! I'm big[?] calm down! Huh? I remember you! You came into our restaurant a couple of days ago, right?
EMI: Yeah, so what?
CHIHO: What's the deal?! Are you his ex, or something?!
EMI: Gwh...Gy...?! Where did you get that idea?!
CHIHO: I was get on! You totally are! In that case, well, I do [a demos?] none of your business, got it?! How'd you know it's good for you? You stay out of my way!
EMI: You don't even know what you saying right now! It's not like that, so why don't you just relax!
CHIHO: Oh yeah? If that's true, tell me why are you always weird? You're like a stalker?!
EMI: You need to stop yacking, little girl! And listen! There is nothing between us!
CHIHO: If anybody here need to stop yacking, it's you, sister!
EMI: You better take that back, now!
CHIHO: You think I'm afraid of you, please?!
MAOU: Can you please take it down, [not your sleeve?]
CHIHO: Ah!
CUSTOMER A: Earthquake!
CUSTOMER B: Get away!
CHIHO: Mr. Maou!
---
CHIHO: Wh-what happened...?
EMI: Oh, good. I'm glad you woke up.
CHIHO: Where are we?
EMI: Well, we're trapped. This used to be the cafe.
CHIHO: Where's Mr. Maou?
EMI: Not with us. I can tell you that much for sure...
CHIHO: Yeah, but...you think he's okay?
EMI: Oh? You are worried he got crushed by the rubble, are you? Well, it's truly make a lot of people happy if he kicked off, me included. ...But I guarantee he is alive.
I'll be the one to defeat him...He's not allowed to die here. No way. No how.
CHIHO: Yeah, right...I'm sure he'll be fine.
EMI: Oh, he will. Trust me on that. ...Emi Yusa. By the way, in case you still wondering, there really is nothing between Maou and me. I swear.
CHIHO: Chiho Sasaki. And, I guess I'll pretend to believe you for now...
EMI: So, what made you fall for him anyway?
CHIHO: Eh?! What are you talking about?! I haven't fallen for him!
EMI: Then, you picked a fight with me in a public restaurant because you don't like him?
CHIHO: No! I do! I mean, I, not like, umm...I guess, I really am super obvious...
EMI: Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
CHIHO: Eww...That might be more comforting if you told me how you really feel about Mr. Maou...?
EMI: How I feel?
CHIHO: For someone who claims to be his enemy, you sure do seem chummy with him whenever you're together...
EMI: Like the god-father says, friends close, and enemies closer.
CHIHO: Huh?
EMI: I've known him for a long time, Chiho. Almost my entire life. Just cause I'm friendly with him doesn't mean what I said to you is any less true. Loving Maou will get you hurt.
CHIHO: I guess I don't quite understand what you mean...?
EMI: You'll get it. But...in reality, maybe it's better if you don't. For now, rest up. You can use a little sleep.
CHIHO: Huh? ah...
EMI: I hear you breathing. She's asleep. You can come out.
MAOU: ...Stay out of my business.
EMI: Maou? What happened to your body?
MAOU: Don't know. It just changed on.
EMI: His magic...it's back...
MAOU: Man...this is the worst. How am I supposed to explain this?
EMI: This is it. Now's my chance! If I focus all of the celestial force I have left, I can still make a sacred sword strong enough to defeat him...!
MAOU: Take care of Chi.
EMI: Eh?
MAOU: These people need me. Hopefully there aren't many casualties. But we don't have time to wait for the rescue squad. I figured something out.
EMI: ...Is he serious?
CHIHO: ...Um.
MAOU: Alright. It's time to go.
EMI**: ...What? Why? Why do the Devil rescue humans?
Chiho: Yesterday sure was rock, huh.
Maou: Yeah. But, we can't stop busting our hunts now, otherwise, Sentucky Fried Chicken might steal all our customers again.
---
Kisaki: I have to go tell corporate about our eighty percent sales drop...No way we want freeze our butts off in Greenland, right?
---
Maou: Ow...
Kisaki: Hey, Ma?
Maou: Ugh?!
Kisaki: I want you to help out in another restaurant.
Maou: No?! Please, don't this to me! I made a sales go plus some! Just like you said!
Kisaki: Wait. It's a fun place.
Maou: Huh?
Kisaki: Besides you're not in trouble, my friend manager in the Hushima-en store wants to borrow my best workers.
Maou: Ohh! That make sense.
Kisaki: Don't thank me just yet. That touring's gonna be out of control busy, the park is opening a bunch of new rides and attractions. So, we'll cover all your expenses and give you a small bonus for your travel. So yeah, think you up for the job?
Maou: Of course, ma'am!
Chiho: Oh. Oh! Can I go with?
Kisaki: That's all right. They can manage without you.
Chiho: Oww, but I wanna...
Kisaki: I'm counting on you, Ma. You're my top crew member. So don't you dare let she down.
Chiho: Hushima-en, huh...
Maou: You got it!
--- OP ---
Ashiya: Oh, tomorrow, you say.
Maou: Yup. You're eating too much fast. You're not fully recovered. Easy up to make yourself worth.
Ashiya: Sire, (Gulp) The noodles expire any day now, we have to consume as many of them as we possibly can. But, thank you very much for your concern.
Urushihara: She's right. Amusement park near at the MgRonald's is re-opening tomorrow. And, rolling out bunch of cool attractions. So, looks like they're expecting a big crowd.
Ashiya: Quit surfing the Inter-web then start help us slip down some noodles.
Urushihara: Oh. They gotta wicked new reptiles exhibit there. Dude! Over three-hundred different species.
Ashiya: Sounds like you'll be busy, Sire.
Maou: Yeah.
Urushihara: Wow! The new haunted house supposed to be scarier than Labyrinth of Shocks. It has everyone says that's the scariest one like they ever seen. So, if a whole bunch of people are going to crazy scary haunted house. That means, there's probably gonna be a butt load of concentrated fear right for the taking...You could get some magic.
Maou: ...
Ashiya: Then, I shall assist you. I will be there to watch over you with true zeal. Don't worry, Sire, with me by your side, nothing can go wrong.
Urushihara: Wait...you're going too?
Ashiya: Yes. It's my duty.
Urushihara: ...Heh.
Ashiya: You stay at home, and try not to burn the place to the ground. ...Now what?
Urushihara: Want pizza. Give me money.
Ashiya: Absolutely not. Such extravaganza is not allowed in this house. You will eat these noodles, and that is end of it. You will then wash the dishes.
Urushihara: Dude, no. How old those noodles they've gotta be turned a little sours by now?
Ashiya: (Munch munch...) Tastes perfectly fine to me. (Gulp) Do not waste them. There are starving children somewhere.
Urushihara: Yeah, whatever, Mom.
Ashiya: Fine! (Inaudible)
Maou: You can stop fighting and hurry up and eat. We gotta get this done.
---
Emi: Hello? Hey, Chiho! What's up? ...Oh? Yeah...An amusement park, huh? ...Sure, why not? I've got the day free tomorrow.
Chiho: Awesome. It should be a lot of fun. And thank you so much! I'm glad you come along, Miss Yusa. Going by myself might've been kind of weird...Cool, I meet you there, then. ...I wish I could go with Mr. Maou, but all well...Eh, heh heh heh...!
---
Emi: ...Hello?
Suzuno: The devils is traveling to Hushima-en tomorrow. I'm certain he plans to collect magic.
Emi: What? Aren't they helping another MgRonald's?
Suzuno: ...I see, words has already reached you then, Emilia?
Emi: Yeah. Chiho told me. I'm going to take the rain to there tomorrow, too. She wants some company. And, that doesn't make any sense. How can he collect magic at amusement park? What do you think he's up to?
Suzuno: You are too trusting, you know? I help you amount a suspicion might do you some good. I would be prudent if I joined you at this park?
Emi: Yeah, whatever. And I'll let Chiho know you tagging along so she isn't caught off guard.
Suzuno: ...The hero trusts him. But, why...?
---
Maou: Hi, my name's Sadao Maou. I'm from Hatagaya store. I'm here to help out today. Good to meet you all.
Manager: Kisaki's told me quite a bit about you. Says you're one of her best.
Maou: I'll do everything I can to live up to your expectations, ma'am.
Manager: Great. Today's gonna be a super busy day, people. So bring your A-game!
Maou: Yes, ma'am!
---
Chiho: Ah, Miss Yusa!
Emi: We're late! I'm sorry.
Chiho: Oh, no big deal. How are you, Miss Suzuno?
Suzuno: I've no complain to speak up. Thank you for asking. Though, I am a bit concern. This is my first time at amusement park. I do hope you will teach me the ways of fun.
Chiho: Of course! I'll be happy too!
---
Chiho: Alright, girls! Let's go!
Emi: Whoa!
Maou: Two special one-pound burgers with secret source!
Stuff: Ready to go!
Chiho: Wow! Miss Yusa, you look like such a grown up in that suits!
Maou: Two small burgers. Piping hot!
Stuff: Ready!
Emi: So, I've gotta ask...
Chiho: Ask what?
Emi: It's, just...You're sixteen, aren't you?
Chiho: I sure am.
Emi: Why, it's not fair...
Chiho: Was it something I said?
Emi: Eh? No. You're just so huge...CUTE, I'm just to say "cute", cute!
Chiho: Wow, thanks a lot! A-ha! I just hope Mr. Maou will think so, too...
Emi: Hmm...
Suzuno: I am prepared!
Emi, Chiho: "Eh?!"
Suzuno: So, let the fun commence! ...Eh?
Emi, Chiho: Umm...
Suzuno: What else, you two?!
---
Maou: Thanks! Have a wonderful day. Next customer, please! What would you like? Two orders of nuggets [extra?] barbecue, and beside a mustard! One iced latte! One hot mocha! Two small burgers, one all-the-way, one no pickles, no lettuce please! Thank you. Come again!
Manager: Nice job, Maou.
Maou: Eh...? Alrighty! Who's up next?! Hey, Chi!
Chiho: Hi, Mr. Maou! How's it going?! Em, I like to order three Big-Mg meals and that's okay?
Maou: (Harrumph) Of course! Here, MgRonald's, we aim to please.
Chiho: Thanks!
Maou: Three Big-Mg combos!
Chiho: I came to hang out at the park.
Maou: Oh, cool!
Chiho: Good luck with the crowd, you're gonna do amazing!
Maou: Yeah, thanks!
Chiho: So, um...do you like it?
Maou: Like what? ...Ah, well, the store's definitely a lot busier than one we work at. The customers' never stopped coming. So, it's been big practice for me.
Chiho: Oh, yes, of course...
Maou: That doesn't kill ya, am I right?
Chiho: Oh, yes, of course...I should've seen this one coming...
Emi: You really are clueless.
Maou: Hm? Eh...what are you two doing here?
Emi: Well, last time I checked, we hard working office ladies are free to do whatever we want on our days off.
Maou: Yeah, great.
Suzuno: I have no coming seeking pleasure. I'm here to learn how people have fun.
Maou: Yeah great.
---
Ashiya: Oww...
Urushihara: Are you gonna croak? Not gonna lie, you look like dookie.
Ashiya: No, I'm fine...Nothing I can't handle...
Urushihara: If I were you, I take some meds.
Ashiya: It's just a stomachache. I don't eat alchemy---eek! Haa...I'm so ashamed...I intended to assist King Satan and his collection of magic, and now look at me...I'm such a disgrace! Truly pathetic...
Urushihara: Take it easy. Stressing out only makes it worse. Seriously...we're already stuck in home anyway. Either stay in there, stay in bed.
Ashiya: Agh!
Urushihara: Dude, don't die, 'kay?
---
Emi: Wow, this place's like crazy crowded.
Chiho: I know. It's like everyone in [among?] to their check out the all new stuff opening.
Suzuno: You mean that haunted house over there?
Chiho: Yup. I hear it's pretty intense!
Emi: So, should we go get in line?
Suzuno: Yes, let's.
Urushihara: You could get some magic.
Suzuno: ...I have several reasons to be interested.
---
Chiho: Uh!
Emi: ...Let's go, girls.
Chiho: Wait! Ohh...Er? Aaaaah!
Emi: Chiho!
Suzuno: Good Chiho?
Emi: ...Wow, she really took off. Wimp.
Suzuno: I suppose we should adventure on without her, then.
Emi: Oops! Eww...
Suzuno: Hmm...
Suzuno: Eh? Chiho?! Is that? ...No? Not her. He appears to be someone else.
Child: Hic...hic...
Suzuno: Hello? Are you all right? ...Child? Why are you crying?
Child: She's gone...
Suzuno: Gone? Who's gone?
Child: My mama...
Suzuno: Where is she?
Child: She's gone...
Suzuno: Alright. Would you...like to come with us, then?
Child: She's gone...My mama...She's gone...She's, she's gone...she's gone...my mama. She's gone, gone, my mama, ma-she's gone, my mama...
Suzuno: Hey, wait...?
Child: It's...it's mama...
Emi, Suzuno: Aaaaaaaghhh!
---
Chiho: Hic...hic...!
Emi: What psycho thought that up...?
Suzuno: They're did not feed my understanding of what you called fun...
---
Emi: Shall we give this a chance? ...Er, hey, Chiho? It's not too late to turn back.
Chiho: Urm...no, I'll go in if you guy's will...
Emi: 'Kay, so I really don't mind we're not going...
Chiho: No! We've come too far to check it out now!
Emi: Yeah, right...
Chiho: Hm!
Suzuno: Perhaps, you're the one who's a bit afraid, Emi?
Emi: Me? Please! I-I just don't like reptiles! That's all!
Chiho: Uhg...I'm not a big fun, either---It's all gross how they can creep in out of nowhere...
Emi: Yeah, gross is right---I hate with a fairly passion.
Chiho: Totally...
Suzuno: Still, it appears they have a rather large variety. I do hope they're edible.
Chiho: Wait...you said "edible?" You like to eat reptiles?!
Suzuno: Yes, they're delicious.
Chiho: Whaat?! When have you done that?!
Suzuno: Oh, many times. But my first is on my journey to the south.
Chiho: South of where...?
Suzuno: A persuasive acquaintance of mine told me I will deeply regret if I did not sample of lizard, so I was left with no alternative.
Chiho: I would say no...
Suzuno: I did protest first, but she was so adamant about how tasty it was.
Chiho: Oh, yack...I can't believe it...
Suzuno: The inn prided itself serving every single part of the lizard. From the head, all the way down to the tip of the tail. I have to admit the lizard-tail soup is truly wonderful.
Chiho: Ugg...
Suzuno: The broth is salty, and rich and chunks of tail are quite delectable. Grotesque to look at, but, honestly, I think it's Ente Isla's finest dish. How remarkable...
Emi: Waah! ...Why are you telling her about Ente Isla?! Have you lost your mind?
Suzuno: Ah...I've miss stepped...!
Chiho: Hmm?
---
Manager: Hey, Maou?
Maou: Ma'am?
Manager: When you finished with those, can you make some in-park deliveries?
Maou: Ma'am!
---
Chiho: Whoa!
Emi: Fu-fu.
Emi: Ugh!
Janitor: Oh! I'm sorry!
Emi: No, it's completely my fault!
Janitor: Please, not at all.
Emi: ...Mm? What's up?
Chiho: You're cute, Ms. Yusa.
Emi: Hm? Oh, you...
---
Maou: MgRonald's delivery! I have your order!
Tamer: Great! We've been waiting for you. Would you mind bring inside, please?
Maou: Just give us a call if you need anything else, okay?
---
Chiho: This is way cool. I had no idea there were so many different types of reptiles!
Emi: Neither did I. Well...do you recognize anything you've eaten for dinner?
Suzuno: Quiet. I have far not to think them as food while they're still alive.
Emi: ...Er?
Chiho: Look, it's a monkey.
Suzuno: Perhaps it's lost. Why is it wearing clothes?
Emi: Hey there, don't be afraid, come on out.
Chiho: Ah!
Emi: Yeah...I don't think I like this monkey...
---
Maou: Thank you for choosing MgRonald's! Will see you next time!
Tamer: Wait...Sadao!
Maou: Eh? ...Sadao?
Tamer: Yeah, he's my monkey.
Maou: Er...monkey, huh?
Tamer: Sadao! Hmm...stupid monkey...come on! Hey, Sadao!
Maou: Um...
---
Tamer: Here, boy! ...Where did you go?
Maou: Err...here, Sadao...
Chiho: So, what do you think we should do with him...?
Emi: Could we take him to the lost children center?
Tamer: Sadao~!
Chiho: Eh...ah!
Tamer: Oh! Sadao! You know it's not safe if you run off on your own like that, buddy?
Maou: Oh, you've found him. Great.
Tamer: Yeah.
Chiho: Mr. Maou!
Maou: Chi. What's up?
Tamer: Thanks, Miss, you're lifesaver.
Chiho: So this little guy's name is Sadao, huh?
Tamer: Yup.
Chiho: Where you'd lost, Sadao~? I tell you what you sure are one lucky monkey, Sadao~?
Tamer: This Sadao has a real weakness for the ladies. He's a full brown problem child.
Emi: Yeah, and clearly your Sadao has a fun of a biggums.
Chiho: "Biggums?"
Emi: Never mind.
Maou: That's enough! Just let him go already!
Chiho: A-ha-ha...
---
Emi: Hop!
Chiho: Step!
Suzuno: ...Spike.
Woman: Whoa! ....Huh? Eeeeek!
Chiho: Hm?
Emi: What's that?
Announce: [Now have an?] urgent notice for all guest. Alligator from the...
Chiho: Uhh...Ah!
Emi: Chiho!
Maou: ...Ah?!
Manager: Everyone! Please try to remain calm! Don't get separated from your children!
Emi: Oh, gosh! You okay?
Chiho: Yeah...
Emi: ...Suzuno?
Maou: (Unclean soul, I call out to you... Return from the netherworld. Vanquish before me...these weak-willed creatures. Unclean soul I call out to you... Return from the netherworld. Vanquish before me...these weak-willed creatures...)
Chiho: Emi...Mr. Maou is using his powers, isn't he?
Emi: Apparently...
Maou: (Unclean soul. Return to me from the netherworld. I call out to you. Vanquish before me these weak-willed creatures)
Suzuno: I don't understand...He could have take advantage of the chaos and absorb its power for personal gain, but instead, he's being selfless, using what he collected to help the humans...King Satan, ruler of demons...what is going on in your head...?
---
Manager: I gotta say, Maou, you did even better than Kisaki said you would.
Maou: Thank you, ma'am. Just doing my job. Well then I still got clean up duty, so I better go. Bye, Chi. I'll catch you later on.
Chiho: See you at work tomorrow!
---
Emi: Well, Maou conveniently veiled.
Chiho: Yeah, kinda...I was worried today might be a disaster, but it turned out all right. It was worth to see Mr. Maou like that.
Emi: I guess, so.
Chiho: Plus, I got to spend a gorgeous day having a blast with two really amazing people! I'm so lucky to have friends like you!
Emi: Yeah, pretty good time is all things considered, right?
Suzuno: Yes, this was fun...
Emi: ...
---
Suzuno: Uh...umm? Hmm...Ah!
Chiho: Ms. Suzuno?
Suzuno: Eh? ...er...huh...
---
Urushihara: So, what's up? Did you get any magic yesterday?
Maou: Hmm...Hard to say whether I got some or just use some up.
Urushihara: Er?
Ashiya: Urushihara is a fool...Nothing he says is to be relied upon under any circumstances...Oh, Sire, I'm so very sorry for interrupting your meal...I'm so rude...
Maou: I gotta hurt just looking at you.
Ashiya: I am in pain. True. But I shall recover...
Urushihara: Oh, he just ate too much.
Ashiya: Silence, rogue! Do not mock me!
Delivery man: Special delivery!
Urushihara: Yes!
Maou: Yeah!
Urushihara: Now, I'll get it! ...Ah! ...Crap! Stupid legs! They are sleeping?!
Maou: One second! I'm right there!
Urushihara: No! Come on! I'll get it!
Delivery man: I gotta delivery for Mr. Hanzou Urushihara.
Maou: Wow, really?
Ashiya: Jungle dot co...
Urushihara: W-well, you see...this is a...
Ashiya: This is what...? Cough it up...! What did you do when I was in the bathroom, you little...ugh!
Maou: Maybe you should see a doctor?
Ashiya: No, no need! It's only a bug...!
Urushihara: You sure about that?
Ashiya: Quiet you...wretched little twerp...! Your worrying makes me feel worse!
Maou, Urushihara: Mm...
Ashiya: Nugh...! Hh...uhh...
TSUBAKI: It's out of there!
GIRL A: She got all of that one!
GIRL B: Just look at it go!
TSUBAKI: No, again.
GIRL A: You don't XXX. What are you waiting for? Go get the ball!
TSUBAKI: Whoa! Sorry! I'm on it!
RYOTA: Homerun, Tsubaki strikes again.
GIRL C: Hey.
TSUBAKI & GIRL C: See you later!
TSUBAKI: Whoa, XXX. Nothing to see here folks, no?
KOUSEI: Ow, my head.
TSUBAKI: Oh, it's just you, Kousei. I heard you were in trouble for a sec.
KOUSEI: Oh, hey, Tsubaki, when did you get up here? Whoa, what happened to the window?! Why is everything red?! You broke it again? We only just got this window fixed!
TSUBAKI: Every window I take out is another knot xxx old bat.
KOUSEI: Just hit them softer, please!
TSUBAKI: You're telling me not to bring a game? This is my last season in middle school. That'll earn me the Triple Crown ready!
KOUSEI: Let's just clean this up.
TSUBAKI: A-hem! Let me grab your dustpan XXX.
KOUSEI: Yes, so I'd have to apologize again? Did happen while I was here.
TSUBAKI: Don't pick it up with your hand, Dummy! What if you cut your own fingers open?
KOUSEI: Well, so what if I did?
RYOTA: You live right next to each other, then friends for ever... You seek each other out no matter where you are. Just get married already.
Kousei & Tsubaki: Don't be an idiot!
RYOTA: Whoa.
TSUBAKI: What are you doing up here with your cell phone, Watari? Aren't you in the middle of soccer practice?
RYOTA: Please don't wear your XXX in here.
TSUBAKI: Man, that stupid vice principal XXX us out for a whole hour. He's just nastiest bald.
RYOTA: Good even worse, he could XXX the offer too, right?
KOUSEI: I didn't even do anything I gonna suffer through all that. Clearly I am the victim here.
TSUBAKI: What, and I'm not? I'm not the one who built the school whose windows right next there where they have a softball. Where should I have played ahead?
RYOTA: I dig all the windows. Makes it easier for the girls inside to cheer for me.
TSUBAKI: Yeah, whatever.
RYOTA: Hey, are you guys hungry?
TSUBAKI: Are girls and food all you would think about?
RYOTA: I'm gonna hit the convenience store. Are you in?
KOUSEI: Why not?
TSUBAKI: Only if you're buying.
KOUSEI: I'm just saying, I was bleeding all over the place. Obviously, ...
TSUBAKI: Wow, this ice cream is delicious! I'm stocking up!
KOUSEI: Never mind.
RYOTA: Dude, Kousei, it sucks to be you, man. How come XXX write two apology letters for one window?
KOUSEI: One for Tsubaki, and one for me. Having been dealing with XXX we were kids, so I'm used to it.
RYOTA: Breaking a suspension bridge on a field trip. Oh, and eh, XXX board in the pool? That was just third grade.
KOUSEI: I thought I was gonna die.
TSUBAKI: Shut up!
KOUSEI: Even though I'm an only child, it's like I have my own high-maintenance big sister.
RYOTA: Kousei is a real prince, huh?
TSUBAKI: He's a real funk, then.
RYOTA: Careful, though. Don't be too nice of a guy. Because when you comes to ladies, they usually finish up last. Hey! I just got a text from Keiko! I get you later, guys.
TSUBAKI: How many is that?
KOUSEI: She's three in counting.
TSUBAKI: I wonder. What do those girls see in him? Uh, he's so shallow!
KOUSEI: Yeah, but he is a good guy in heart.
TSUBAKI: Don't tell him that. What about you?
KOUSEI: Hm?
TSUBAKI: You crushing on anyone?
KOUSEI: What?
TSUBAKI: Miwa told me something. She told me when you are in love, the world's to start looking more colorful.
KOUSEI: I don't think I'll ever inspire that kind of change in someone.
TSUBAKI: Um. Stop that! You're fourteen years old. There is no sparkling in your eye! What the hell!
KOUSEI: My eyes are dark. I don't think they are gonna sparkle that much.
Soji & Miharu: Whoa!

Soji: Whoa, it's so fast! How far down does it go?
This is awesome! How did you manage to build this in one night?

Twoearle: Once we detect the enemy on the radar screen, this space-jump catapult can send you anywhere. You can go to Brazil, Aomori, or anywhere else on the planet in seconds. The progress of the battle can be followed in real time on these multimonitors, which are tied into a satellite system that oversees the whole operation. If combat reinforcement or service becomes necessary, it can be addressed in a matter of moments with this maintenance booth.

Soji: You've done an incredible job, Twoearle.

Aika: Maybe. But don't you think this is all just a little bit over the top? How many guys does Ultimaguil have, anyway?

Twoearle: The truth is, we really don't know. It can be thousands or millions.

Aika: Wait. What?! Soji has to fight millions of these perverts by himself?!

Miharu: Now, now, Aika. I'm sure there is someone else there who can help him to fight.

Twoearle: There are other candidates, but they're still under review. Once I've selected a man, we have another Tail Gear ready to go!

Aika: In that case, just pick one. What the heck are you waiting for?

Miharu: Hmm.

Twoearle: Well, the thing is... The person I have in mind is kind of a nefarious person who's prone to the pits of rage of violence. I have to be sure they can handle this type of responsibility.

Miharu: Huh...

Soji: Whoever this person is, they must have some powerful twin-tail attribute, right? As much as we need help, it won't work if there's a bad apple.

Aika: Who cares who they are? You can't fight with monsters alone. You're gonna need backup!

Soji: Oh, I'll be fine. I think I might be even getting a little stronger.

Twoearle: Elemelian readings coming from Makuhari.

Soji: All right! I'm out! Tail On!

---- <OP> ----

Soji: Not long after that, I started to have some serious second thoughts. Those monsters started appearing every day like clockwork, and I had chased them all over the fricking planet. Because I was after kicking some serious butt on a global scale, Tailred's profile shot through the roof.

Foreign Songstress: Yeah, that's right. I love twin-tails. I live twin-tails and I breathe twin-tails. Tailred just rocks! So let me hear it!

Erina: She's so incredible! She's so incredible! What I would give to be a hero in fight against the forces of evil! Oh! Mikoto, wasn't there a request to establish twin-tail's club here on campus?

Mikoto: That's correct. But the club's activities aren't specified as of yet, and since there's no qualified faculty member to serve as a club adviser, it will never pass.

Erina: An adviser, huh?

Girl A: You're the coolest! Will you please XXX be my best friend?

Girl B: Tailred is the awesomest person in the whole world. If she's gonna be anyone's best friend, she's gonna be mine!

Tailred: 'Kay, that's enough, please! Seriously, guys, let me go!

Soji: Aah! Turn it off! I'm gonna lose my fricking mind here!

Aika: No, Soji. You're gonna watch what you did. Look yourself shamelessly shoving your face on a bunch of strange girls' boobs! Explain yourself!

Soji: It's not like I had a choice! That's just what happens when you are hugged by someone taller than you!

Anchorman: In other news, local police are asking all citizens in hope to locate this young XXX girl known as Tailred.

Soji: Oh, come on! Why don't they leave me alone and talk about those Ultimaguil jerks?!

Twoearle: Mr. Soji! You're gonna want to take a look at this. Comprehensive Tailred blogs, fan sites, and discussion threads. You're the talk of the entire Internet! The digital world is going crazy over you. There are even translated fan sites in other countries.

Soji: This is insane! What the heck are people so obsessed by my female self!


Aika: He is acting weird? Yeah, well, what else is new?

Twoearle: Oh, no, Soji is taking weird to a new level.

Aika: Huh? What's going on?!

Twoearle: Let's just say his curiosity has been peaked. He asked me earlier if it was possible to remove his suit after transforming. You know what that means, right?

Aika: Hold on, are you saying...

Twoearle: Oh, yes. Mr. Soji's grown for it. He is about to get a variant touch of this female side.

Aika: This should be good.

Soji: Tail On.

Twoearle: Oh! Get ready? Things are about to get extremely interesting. Yeah, come on, Tailred.

Aika: What do I do? I kind of don't want to watch, the other kind of do. I wonder he's actually gonna...

Tailred: So this is what boobs look like? They are soft and squishy. How about down there?

Aika: I can't watch, Twoearle! No, it's too much! What's happening?

Twoearle: Well, it looks to me like Soji's putting his fingers right where it counts...!

Aika: Eh?

Tailred: I never thought that I have my own twin-tails to play with whenever I want! Being a girl is awesome and I wanna stay like this forever!

Aika: I should have known...

Twoearle: I'm sorry but I'm not sorry. Now that he has his own twin-tails, he'll probably forget about yours altogether.

Aika: What did you say?

Anti-Aika Security System MK1: Kick Aika's butt. Kick Aika's butt. ...

Aika: Okay, what is this?

Twoearle: The Anti-Aika Security System MK1 for protecting lovely young ladies from a flat-chested psychopath!

Anti-Aika Security System MK1: Aika got my butt kicked...


Soji: Good morning, you guys. Twoearle, what the heck happened to you?

Twoearle: Oh, don't worry, I'll be fine. No matter how advanced my science is, I realize now it is completely powerless against a barbarian like Miss Aika.

Miharu: Now, Soji, since you don't have to go to school today, I want you to stay home to take good care of Twoearle.

Twoearle: Thank you very much for being so incredibly sweet. If you should need me, I'll be in bed, completely naked.

Soji: Hold on, just a minute!

Aika: Good morning, everybody!

Miharu: Aika, why are you standing there? Go and help them.

Twoearle: Oh, I almost forgot! Please make sure to use Elemeletion in your Tail Gear equipment.

Soji: Hold on, what's Elemeletion?

Twoearle: It's powerful attribute strength from all the orbs you've collected so far.

Soji: Thanks a lot for heads up, but I'm a true twin-tail warrior. Remember? I prefer to fight on twin-tail power as much as possible!

Twoearle: Yes, of course. I understand.

Soji: Tail On!


Tailred: Huh? Nobody's being attacked.

Fox Guildy: Ah, infamous Tailred! I am Fox Guildy. At last, we meet face to face.

Tailred: You just have popped up and ruined my afternoon. I was hoping to get a day off! You idiots don't know when to quit, do you?!

Fox Guildy: So far, you've defeated every one of my comrades. You've left me no choice but to challenge you and bring you down once and for all.

Tailred: Uh, get real! I bet I can defeat you with one shot!

Fox Guildy: They sway back and forth with she moves like pretty little ribbons. It just melts my heart.

Tailred: I see. You're ribbon attribute.

Fox Guildy: That's right. To think that the sword that defeated my brawny comrades was a product of those beautifully delicate ribbons of yours... I sense this is fate.

Tailred: Hmph! What is this stuff?!

Fox Guildy: How beautiful! Ribbons look so lovely on such a pretty young girl. Now, you are going to give yourself to me.

Tailred: Don't say things like that! It's disgusting!

Fox Guildy: I will take everything you have to offer.

Tailred: What have you done?!

Fox Guildy: Oh... l-l never imagined it would be this good!

Tailred: What the heck is wrong with this guy?

Twoearle: You must not like your guard down, Mr. Soji!

Tailred: Oh, what's up, Twoearle?

Twoearle: You should slay him now, while you still have the chance!

Fox Guildy: Now, crystallize, my love!

Tailred: Whoa, that's turning into twin-tails! Wait, is... is that me?

Fox Guildy: Ribbons are for tying. And now I have my own Tailred. Did you [wait as I] please, and there's nothing you can do to stop me. I have taken your divine twin-tail attribute, and using my own attribute strength I have bounded up forever and never.

Tailred: I don't understand. Are you saying you copied my power?

Fox Guildy: Of course not. It's just a mannequin. I don't have doll attribute like my comrade Lizard Guildy so I like the power to make it move on my own. But it's still a sight to behold, don't you think?

Tailred: Hey, stop that! You are giving me goose bumps!

Fake Tailred: Hooray! I love bath-time!

Fox Guildy: Now, now, you mustn't run. I'm not done toweling you off yet. You're going to catch a cold if you keep this up.

Tailred: Mmm, am I losing my mind here? Where is my mannequin self showing up a little too much skin.
Stop touching me!

Aika: It's so gross! Come on, Soji, hurry up and finish that creep off once and for all!

Twoearle: Miss Aika is absolutely correct. Forget about that fake Tailred! Don't feel sorry for it! Smash it to pieces!

Tailred: Yeah, you're right. Okay, fine! I'll kill you with one shot, you degenerate!

Aika: What's the matter? Now's your chance, Soji!

Tailred: It's no use! I can't! If I destroy those twin-tails, I can never forgive myself! I refuse... ! I know it's just a doll, and I know it's probably uninstrumental evil, but regardless, those twin-tails have done nothing to deserve this!

Twoearle: Mr. Soji, you are amazing!

Aika: What are you, dense?!

Fox Guildy: You really are a genuine article.

Tailred: What?

Fox Guildy: It's a mere mannequin, yet you still can't bring yourself to destroy its twin-tails. That indeed is true love. A testament to the fact you possess the ultimate twin-tail attribute.

Tailred: Come on, think. What am I going to do?

Fox Guildy: Hm, well, you can party with me, if you want to?

Tailred: What did you just do?

Fox Guildy: What a lovely present. Don't worry. I will be very tender.

Tailred: Please. Someone, help!

Aika: There's gotta be something we can do to help him!

Twoearle: I'm not sure what you expect me to do about it.

Aika: How the heck should I know! Launch a missile at him! We have to do something! If we don't, that frickle takes advantage of Soji!

Twoearle: Oh, that sounds kind of fun!

Aika: Huh?

Twoearle: Kidding, I'm kidding. At this point, I have no other choice. I must make the ultimate decision.

Aika: Wait. What?

Twoearle: Miss Aika, I need you to transform.

Aika: All right. I'll do it! Uh?! I can do that?!

Twoearle: Listen. I kept it from you too long. Mr. Soji is not the only person in this world who can harness this awesome power of the Tail Gear. You can do it too.

Aika: Wait a second. I thought you said that the other qualified candidate was a violent and nefarious person!

Twoearle: I'm just being honest.

Aika: Stop kidding around!

Twoearle: I'm sorry. The truth is, I didn't tell you because I didn't want to put you in any more danger. Over the last couple of days, I have put you in harm's way time and time again, Miss Aika. You are one of the few friends I've made on this planet and I don't wanna lose you.

Aika: That's so sweet. But what's the real reason?

Twoearle: Yeah, I was a lie. Truth is, I had a plan from the very beginning. I was going to tell an elaborate story about how the only way to maintain the integrity of the Tail Gear was to infuse my biological data with Mr. Soji's. I was gotta use big science to get in a touch of malice. But Miss Aika, I just realized something. If I give you the Tail Gear, in order to keep my story consistent, I would have no other choice but love XXX you as well!

Aika: You are one sick, perverted chick! Seriously, though, is there ever a moment when your mind isn't in the gutter?!

Twoearle: What's wrong with wanting a handsome young man to service you from time to time?!

Aika: Do you know how disgusting that sounds?!

Twoearle: Please, I'll tell you the truth. Just stop hitting me!

Aika: This is your last chance, understand?

Twoearle: The truth is, the other Tail Gear is built for a larger bust, so from a design standpoint, I was hoping XXX another woman's body!

Aika: Hey, that's enough! If you don't stop making stupid comments about the size of my chest, you dead! You hear me?! I don't care about the size! I may not be suited for a big bust Tail Gear, but it isn't worth trading Soji's life over!

Twoearle: Miss Aika, listen. When I said you were a dear friend, I wasn't lying. I swear.

Aika: Where's this coming from?

Twoearle: Although we may be protecting your world, it's also revenge that I'm after. And while it pains me to force Mr. Soji to fight them when he isn't directly involved, the truth is this. If I send you to fight and something happens, I feel fairly certain Mr. Soji will never forgive me for it.

Aika: Those perverts go after twin-tails, right? That means they come after me. And I'll feel better by XXX defending myself. I may not be as passionate about saving others like Soji, but I can do my part.

Twoearle: Once you put the bracelet on, there can be no turning back.

Aika: I'm not a child. I accept responsibility for my actions. I'll be just fine. All right?

Twoearle: Miss Aika, I want you to promise me. No matter what...

Aika: No matter what?

Twoearle: ...you will allow me to be the first woman that Mr. Soji ever touches on--

Aika: Give me that!

Twoearle: There isn't any time for this! You have to promise me right now. Otherwise, I'll keep this dumb thing for myself. Hold on. Judging by the way you are looking at me, it appears you are considering slapping me in the face, knocking me down and taking the bracelet by force! I certainly hope you're not the type of person.

Aika: I'm coming to help you, Soji! Tail On!

Tailred: Ugh, no, please...!

Tailblue: That's enough!

Tailred: A blue Tail Gear?

Dragguildy: That blue armor... Don't tell me it's the same twin-tail we battled before!

Fox Guildy: And who might you be?

Tailblue: A twin-tail warrior, who fights alongside Tailred, protects those who can't protect themselves. The name's Tailblue!

Tailred: Aika?

Tailblue: Fox Guildy!

Fox Guildy: Mm-Hmm?

Tailblue: Now that I'm here, I'm not gonna let you have your way with Tailred anymore! Prepare to die!

Fox Guildy: Ha-ha-ha, you have a marvelous pair of twin-tails yourself, little blue lady! Let me give you the most fitting ribbon I can possibly [muster].
I can't have you underestimating my power, can I? It will take quite a bit of strength to break through my ribbon...

Tailblue: Lucky for me, then. I have quite a bit more than "quite a bit."

Fox Guildy: Hmm, indeed, you do seem to possess a rather uncommon strength. However, for that very reason, you will not be able to destroy my replica mannequin...

Tailred: Thanks a lot, Tailblue! You saved my neck.

Fox Guildy: No, that's impossible! How could you destroy my creation without so much as a second thought? That mannequin was an exact replica of your adorable little red companion!

Tailblue: Yeah, so what? Maybe it looked like her, but a fake is still a fake. As for my precious companion, well, she is one of the kind nobody could ever take her place.

Tailred: Thanks, Tailblue.

Fox Guildy: Damn, you! In that case... 

Tailblue: Do you think I'm scared of ribbons? Time for Elemeletion! Go!
This is Turtle Guildy's gym-shorts attribute! It's supposed to control gravity!

Fox Guildy: Damn it!

Tailblue: Try this one [up] besides! Half-gravity!

Fox Guildy: My beautiful ribbon! Come back!

Tailblue: Now the finisher! Wave Lance, go! I may be new to the battlefield, but when it comes to twin-tails, I've been at it a way longer! So XXX!

Fox Guildy: O-One last dream, before I die...! Running around without clothes again? You'll catch a cold if you keep this up. Oh, wait. Ribbon is clothes. What an incredible idea! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Tailblue: Hello, everyone. I'm Tailred's sidekick, Tailblue. And if you please, you may refer to the two of us as the Twin Tails.
Wow! These things are handy!

Tailred: Sorry about this. I really am helpless, huh.

Tailblue: Don't get the wrong idea. I transformed because I decided to. Okay?

Reporter: Wait a second!

Tailblue: This is awesome!


Aika: What is this? Huh?! Somebody wanna tell me what's going on?!

Miharu: Oh, how about we just check the other stations instead?

Anchorman: Yes! Yes! Once again, Tailred stole our hearts by standing at the bad guys.

Anchorwoman: Indeed! Social media was overwhelmed with postings about how cute she was for fighting through tears. And how she never quit, even when things got off!

Anchorman: She really is adorable, isn't she?

Anchorwoman: However, serious questions about this mysterious blue person keep piling up.

Anchorman: It's true. She looks a lot like Tailred, but there is a chance that she's a copycat villain, who patterns herself after Tailred and nearly pretends to be a sidekick, but whose true intentions are much more insidious.

Aika: What the hell is this?! Why XXX?!

Soji: G-Guys, stop, seriously! Take it easy!

---- <ED> ----

Aika: I may have been in a huff earlier, but attribute strength is really amazing! I can even fly now!

Twoearle: Endlessly gaining new effects by loading in different orbs is what Elemeletion is. There are all sorts of moves you can do with this power! 

Aika: All right! Let's keep on going at it, Soji!

Twoearle: Yeah!

Aika: Next time will be our very first joint mission as the Twin Tails, after all!

Soji: Eh?

Twoearle: That's right. You two are like Beauty and the Beast! 

Aika: Hey! Who are you calling "Beast," you top-heavy twin?!

Soji: Next time: "Ferocity - Twin Battle!"

Twoearle: Tail On...
Soji: What the...? Am I...?

Twoearle: I'm glad to see you are finally awake, Mr. Soji.

Soji: Hey, this is my room!

Twoearle: I hope this is all right. I took the liberty of teleporting us here.

Soji: Where's Aika?

Twoearle: She took the hint and was kind enough to leave us alone for a while.

Soji: Huh?

Aika: Tell me where they are right now! How dare you leave me astray there like that!

Twoearle: Don't make me out to be the villain. I was trying to do you a favor. Since you are absolutely and unequivocally not involved in this, I was nice enough to leave you behind and not to trouble you anymore.

Aika: Is that you call "nice", you jerk?!

Soji: Ah! Calm down, Aika! Look, I need you to explain some things to me. First of all, who were those guys? And why the heck did I turn into a girl?!

Twoearle: Are you sure you want to know?

Soji: Yeah, of course I am.

Twoearle: Then I will answer you. But you must touch my heart to know the truth.

Aika: No, you don't!!

--------<OP>--------

Dragguildy: Have you arrived at a conclusion yet?

Fox Guildy: Yes. We believe that this is optimal for that beautiful goddess.

Swan Guildy: No. Hear! Take a look at my prototype!

Elemelians: (Hum of voices)

Dragguildy: You must take your cases to Tailred directly. More importantly, what is the council's determination? Unless I'm mistaken, I believe I told you to decide which one of you would attack her next!

Twoearle: After they - after Ultimaguil had already invaded and destroyed many other civilizations, they came to this planet, and XXX to steal all of the attribute strength called "elemela."

Soji: They are invading civilizations?

Aika: Just so unclear. What is attribute strength, again?

Twoearle: It's quite simple, Miss Aika. It's the love you're feeling in your heart.

Aika: Oh, okay.

Twoearle: For example, you have a great affection for twin-tails, that affection has been condensed into mental energy, and it's called "twin-tail attribute." To put it in another way, attribute strength is what a person deeply believes. And these monsters... They feed off these deep desires. It's the greatest need they possess.

Aika: So in other words, it's like food or water? They can't survive without it?

Twoearle: Mmm... in basic terms, yes, that's correct. But it's not that simple. They desire the twin-tail attribute the most. It is widely considered to be the strongest attribute of them all.

Soji: So twin-tails are... the strongest?

Aika: What? That can't be right?

Twoearle: I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's a fact. It's what the Elemelians live for. But Soji, trust me. You can stand up to them. Don't be afraid! Tail Gear is mighty counter-elemelian armor. It's based on incredible attribute strength. And as a result, it takes a lot of attribute strength to control it. That's where you come in, Soji.

Twoearle: Wait a second. Are you saying that something did appreciate my deep love for twin-tails?

Aika: All right. Slow down. Are there better examples of the power of love? I get that some people are really into twin-tails, but what about friendship or love of your family?

Twoearle: Those types of desires are instinctive to most creatures of a certain level of common intelligence. They are universally held attributes. This needs to be the kind of love for something that leads you spellbound. And deep obsession for which you'd willingly risk your life. That's it! That's the cornerstone of attribute strength.

Aika: What kind of idiot would risk their life over something like twin-tails?

Soji: This kind of idiot! So why don't you just back off!

Aika: So lame...

Twoearle: I was not wrong to fall for you at first sight, and I'm so happy I did. I see now that giving you the Tail Gear was the best decision I ever made. Your love for the twin-tail is the greatest love there is. You are the chosen one, after all.

Soji: Wait, seriously? I'm really the chosen one?

Fox Guildy: Look at the petite little body. So small, and yet she was able to defeat Lizard Guildy. We are studying this video carefully to make certain that we would not make the same mistakes next time.

Dragguildy: You have fallen in love with this twin-tail, haven't you? Indeed, she is a deeply mystical girl with an oddly intimidating presence. It will not be easy to steal from her.

Snake Guildy: True! But remember that's just the kind of challenge that gets the warrior's blood pumping!

Dragguildy: Do you have a plan?

Snake Guildy: Yes! In order to restrict her movement, I'll dress her up like a maid! I want to see her maid's apron strings popping through the air in perfect harmony with those big beautiful twin-tails. It will be a sight to behold!

Elemelian: No! Even better, dress her in summer outfit, and splash her with water making her cloth cling tightly against her body! Once her up outfit is wet, we would be able to see everything dearest to see.

Worm Guildy: Not good enough! Hear me! Tie her up with ropes, so the only part of her body that has freedom to move about is her twin-tails!

Dragguildy: Silence! It is hard to say which of your ideas is the most effective, therefore, we will decide who will attack her next in a close-up battle!

Aika: Not to interrupt, but why are you guys still staring at each other?

Twoearle: Yeah, it is a bit strange. In that case, Mr. Soji...

Aika: No, you don't tell that!

Soji: Will you two stop fighting so I can get some straight answers? I still don't understand the reason why I turned into a girl!

Twoearle: Are you sure you want to know?

Soji: I am.

Twoearle: Typically, becoming a woman means your bud has blossomed, that is achieved by the age of sexual maturity in that it takes a man's...

Aika: If you don't give us a real answer, good and I make your elbow be in the other way!

Twoearle: Um, the truth is, the answer is incredibly personal, and if I've been completely honest, it's not easy to talk about at all.

Soji: Hmm?
Aika: Huh?

Twoearle: You see the reason Mr. Soji becomes a girl when he transforms is because I have a taste for cute girls! ls that a crime?!

Soji: Hey! No judgment over here!

Twoearle: Don't you dare to try me you didn't enjoy it, mister. Besides, in the Tailred form, you can draw the enemy out in the open area with the lure of your twin-tails. It's the best strategy to defeat them. And Lizard Guildy learned in a hard way when it comes to the battle that you're not just cute little play thing, you're powerful combatant who's not to be taken XXX.

Soji: Oh, speaking of that creepy lizard monster, after I beat him, I picked up this thing.

Aika: Wow, that's so pretty! What is it?

Twoearle: That, Miss Aika, is a crystallization of the ability strength that the Lizard Guildy created to using. That stone is commonly called an elemela orb.

Soji: This might sound weird, but the moment I picked it up, I had the image of a doll in my head.

Aika: A doll? Hold on, does that mean Lizard Guildy was obsessed with dolls?

Twoearle: That's right. Or to be more specific, he is really XXX of little girls holding dolls. It's weird.

Soji: I see. So that's why he wanted me to do that.

Lizard Guildy: Would you do me a small favor and hug this?

Soji: But isn't that a bit unusual?

Twoearle: Isn't what unusual?

Soji: Well, if he XXX little girls holding dolls, he should be stealing the attribute strength of doll-lovers, right? But by doing so, the girls wouldn't love dolls anymore, which means that in reality his actions would lead to a perpetual cycle of self-inflicted disappointment.

Twoearle: Hmm. Yes, that is correct; you might very well say these Elemelians are paradoxical beings or paradoxical pervs.

Aika: Paradoxical, huh?

Soji: Mm-hmm.

Turtle Guildy: I figured it would come down to the two of us, Fox Guildy.

Fox Guildy: I'll be the one standing when it's all over, Turtle Guildy.

Turtle Guildy: I wouldn't be so sure.

Fox Guildy: Let's go!

Turtle Guildy & Fox Guildy: One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors!

Fox Guildy: Total domination!

Soji: Wow... By the way, Twoearle, you haven't really told us much about yourself.

Twoearle: Oh, you wanna know me? Okay then. Fine. Here goes! Come to bed, and you'll know me.

Aika: Over my dead body! He didn't mean "know you" like that, boobs for brains!

Twoearle: Truth is, it is not a very happy story. I thought at least I can do with this is turn it into pillow talk.

Aika: You are weird!

Soji: We're fine just like this. Please, I'd like to hear it.

Twoearle: As you wish, Mr. Soji. Many years ago my home planet was invaded by the Ultimaguil organization.

Soji: They invaded your planet? They destroyed it too?

Twoearle: No. They only stole our attribute strength. There was no looting or carnage. But all that remains is a lonely world devoid of hope. Even though they spared our lives, there's nothing as cruel or quiet as invasion like that. The pain of a world without love is a devastating sight to behold.

Strawberry Twin: Uh-oh. No. That's insane. I would never wear my hair like that. Not in million years.

Soji: When I took out Lizard Guildy, even the student council president went back to normal. If I can defeat Ultimaguil, then your people might go back to normal too, right?

Twoearle: I'm afraid not... The reason the damage was reversed is because how fast you were able to beat them yesterday. Once the Elemelians are taking your ability strength, unless the enemy is defeated within 24 hours time XXX, you can never go back to the way you were.

Soji: 24 hours, that's it?

Twoearle: Yes, that's it. Which means when they attack, we have to strike fast.

Soji: All right, then. In order to avenge your world and protect mine, I will use this awesome power! I will do whatever is required!

Twoearle: Thank you very much! In that case, there is one important thing we have to discuss first. When you go into battle, you are going to need some backup, which is why I'm going to construct a super-secret layer underneath your house.

Soji & Aika: Huh?!

Miharu: It's finally time. At last, the moment I've been waiting for is here.

Soji: But that's impossible, in more ways than one!

Aika: Yeah! Any way you look at it, it's completely absurd!

Twoearle: Don't worry. I've got it covered. With my scientific capabilities, I can finish the base before morning, without anybody knowing.

Soji & Aika: Uh-ugh...

Twoearle: But there's one small issue. Before I do anything, Mr. Soji, I need you to get your mother's permission for me to live here with you.

Soji: Huh?!
Aika: Huh?! There is no way for her to agree to...

Miharu: It's okay by me.

Soji & Aika: Are you for real?!

Miharu: Absolutely! I heard everything you said.

Soji: Hold on a second. You heard everything?!

Miharu: What I thought that story on the news, I knew that was you who were doing good deeds. I'm so proud!

Aika: I don't understand! How are you so calm about all this!?

Miharu: I've kept a truth from you for too long. It's time that I told you everything.

Soji: Wait. Did you know all about this? Then I would be the one chosen to wear the Tail Gear?!

Miharu: Oh no, don't be ridiculous!

Soji: Then, what are you talking about?

Miharu: I'm talking about my dream.

Soji & Aika: Your dream?

Miharu: When I was a young girl, I dreamed [of] becoming a superheroine who saved the world, but instead, all I became was your mother. So I passed along my hopes and aspirations to you, so you could achieve the dream I had.

Twoearle: Oh, that is so sweet!

Soji: What are you saying!? Did you do something to me before I was born?!

Miharu: I'm pretty sure your father wanted to be a superhero when he was young, too!

Soji: I'm seriously losing my patience.

Twoearle: In that case, I have a quick question!

Miharu: Ask me anything, Twoearle?

Twoearle: "I don't know what to do. We don't have a spare futon for you. Oh wait! I know! You can just sleep in the same bed as Soji will be here!" Well, it wasn't a question, really. But that's a kind of thing that I'm trying to get you to say.

Aika: Are you insane?!

Soji: Hey, did you forget that I'm sitting right here?!

Miharu: Twoearle, you are lovely! I'm so glad someone like you is here. You are the answer to my prayer and I would be honored to have you as a guest. My house is yours, for anything that you might need. "But I don't know what to do. We don't have a spare futon for you. Oh, hey! How about you just to sleep in Soji's room instead!"

Soji & Aika: Are you serious?!

Twoearle: You are sweet! Thank you very much, Mom!

Miharu: I have one condition. You have to promise you make a man out of Soji.

Twoearle: Consider it done!

Aika: Come with me! Right now!
She is not to be trusted. If you let that woman stay here, you'll be putting your son's virtue in jeopardy!

Miharu: Oh, believe me, I know. A sexy space girl from another planet moving in suddenly making things hot and heavy! This is exactly what I fantasized about! It won't bother me one XXX if she forces herself on Soji, and actually I'll be upset if she doesn't.

Aika: And you have the nerve to call yourself his mother?!

Miharu: Yes, I do. And I'm proud of it. I'm his mother. And the only thing that I have ever wanted from my baby boy is for him to have a girlfriend! I hoped it might be you, but I guess the sweet little girl he's known since his childhood never found a courage to make a move.

Aika: Wait, what?! What are you talking about?

Miharu: But this Twoearle - I can tell she's the one XXX I'm looking to those eyes - the eyes of an unprincipled girl who's out for my son's virginity no matter what!

Aika: You would take that kind of risk of complete stranger?

Miharu: No! Twoearle is now a proper member of the family.

Twoearle: My dearest mother!

Aika: Whoa, Ow.
Twoearle: Forgive me for saying this to you, but I am not unprincipled, mother, not even a little. But you are absolutely right about my interest in attempting steal his virginity.

Miharu: I thank you, you just made my life!

Twoearle: Oh, I'm glad to hear it. With your permission, I will go and build the secret underground base right away.

Miharu: Well, you do that? I'll also go, and make some awesome dinner!

Twoearle: If I catch you picking, you're gonna be in a big trouble!

Aika: Soji! Be sure to lock your door when you go to sleep tonight, okay?

Soji: Okay, but why?

Aika: You know "why". Please! Just do as I say, and lock that door, and I weld the stupid thing shut!

Soji: It's made of wood.

Aika: Be careful. There's a lot she's still hiding.

Soji: Uh? A lot of what?

Aika: She said that Ultimaguil invaded her world and stole all of the attribute strength, but how did she get a hand on the twin-tail attribute that makes up the main core of the Tail Gear? Whatever you do, just don't let your guard down with her, okay?


Turtle Guildy: I admit. I never imagined you were this good. But I will not be beaten!


Soji: That evening, even though I should've been worn out with everything that was going on, I couldn't sleep at all. The sounds of the super-secret base being built downstairs which were just too weird... What were those sounds anyway? If the scientific capabilities were really advanced, then why is it so loud?

Twoearle: I'm officially done, building the super-secret layer. So why don't you give me a super-secret smooch...

Soji: No, Twoearle, hold on. I think this is moving too fast...

Aika: Hey, you! Put XXX away!


Soji: I'm leaving!

Miharu: Be careful out there! My heroine!

Aika: Good morning, Soji. Did you check out the news?

Soji: Why? What's you got there?

Aika: It's nothing, really. The Tailred XXX get much coverage.

Soji: Yeah, we'll XXX the breaking news in my mom's mind, I don't know what I'm gonna do about her.


Soji: Oh, boy...

Classmate A: Whoa! That looks exactly like her!

Classmate B: Your [You are?] manga XXX!

Classmate C: Wait, dude, check out this "Tailred".

Classmate A: Yeah, you are totally nailing that, man.

Soji: Hey! How do you guys know about Tailred?!

Classmate D: From this incredible picture! People are posting it everywhere, dude! Oh, she is so fricking cute! I can't take it! If I keep looking at this, my head's gonna explode!

Soji: Oh, this is bad. I feel dizzy.

Classmate: She's the cutest chick I've ever seen!

Classmate: I used to be more of a boob man, but I've come around.

Classmate C: Wow, look at those lips! I just wanna kiss them!

Soji: Cut it out, you sickos!

Classmate C: What do you think you are doing, man?!

Soji: You should be all ashamed of yourself! She's just a little girl!

Classmate C: Huh? Poor little Soji, you want to have Tailred all to yourself, and is now upset because you have to share with the rest of us, isn't it right?

Soji: That's not it at all!

Erina: Attention, students. We will now be holding a special school assembly. Please report to the gymnasium at once.

Soji: What is going on? I feel so objectified.

Erina: Fellow students, as many of you know, we faced an unprecedented crisis yesterday, as mysterious monsters looked to have our community. I know firsthand, because I was one of the first people on the scene, one of the first to be attacked. But here I stand. In front of you, all safe and sound, because I was saved by a hero of justice that swept onto the scene like a gust of wind, blew those monsters away!

Soji: Don't tell me she knows it was me!

Erina: Oh, not "hero." I meant to say "heroine." I've had my heart completely stolen away by this incredible girl. After morning's news has been uploaded on the Internet, I selected this one for you to see.

Soji: Ah, does somebody tell me what's happening?

Erina: The Shindo Family will support this young woman with everything we have. And so, students and teachers, join with me in supporting her! Well, here's to our new savior!

Soji: This is crazy. I'm a savior?! And a super-cute twin-tailed heroine that everyone is in love with at that? But I'm a boy.


Soji: I'm exhausted. I think I need a nap.

Aika: Are you going to continue on as Tailred?

Soji: Uh?

Aika: When we get home, that secret base should be finished, right? You'll need to make decision.

Soji: Mmm... I've got time. It's not that they're appearing in the sky every five minutes?

Aika: I wouldn't be so sure.

Dragguildy: Attention, all XXX earthlings occupying this planet! We are the chosen disciples of the universe. We are Ultimaguil!We have no intention of bringing you any harm. All we want is the powerful light of love that shines in each of your hearts. Resistance is futile! As long as you do not resist, your lives will be secure. Allow us to take the light of your hearts freely. Away, and your days of peace and tranquility will continue!

Soji: If I let them do this, our lives will be secure at all! If these monsters take away our desires, this won't be a world of peace or tranquility, but a world of apathy and boring hair styles, and there's no way in hell I'm letting that happen!

Aika: Is that mean...

Twoearle: Mr. Soji, did you see that just now?

Soji: Yeah, sure I did.

Twoearle: I'm picking up Elemelian readings on the newly-finished base's radar.

Soji: I have to stop them! Tell me where.

Twoearle: At Kyuaru High School, in the next town over.

Soji: Okay, I know exactly where that is. Here.

Twoearle: I almost forgot! I thought up an activation code for the Tail Gear, so call it out when you ready.

Soji: Wait, you mean a transformation cry?

Twoearle: Yes. The activation code is "Tail On!"

Soji: Tail On!

Tailred: I don't understand. Why Kyuaru High School?

Twoearle: I can't be certain. According to the Internet, it's a school that uses old-style gym uniforms. Pretty rare these days.

Turtle Guildy: My name is Turtle Guildy! Before I start looking for twin-tail attribute strength, I'll take a moment to admire your cute gym shorts!

Tailred: That's one last creepy monster!
No! Please! Ah-h...

Soji: By that second day, I had become a celebrity. Sorry, I mean, Tailred had become a celebrity. She was generating a lot of buzz all around the world. Apparently, even NASA responded to the Ultimaguil organization's declaration of war, I just hope this thing doesn't become some kind of a big deal.

Soji: This Tail Gear is awesome!

Twoearle: Yes! The full-body-enveloping, lightweight, and flexible metal photon mail, is 80 times harder than diamond, and yet still as supple as silk. Its punching power is 100 tons, and its kicking power is 150!

Aika: What about these Excelion Shorts?

Twoearle: Oh, right! They're shorts that wick away moisture quickly.

Aika: But why shorts?

Twoearle: To make a long story short, sometimes when a battle gets drawn out, you may have to tinkle, and nobody wants to [expel urine]..

Soji: Uh, I'm okay. That's enough! Next time: "The Azure Surge! Tailblue."

Aika: Tail On!
MC: Previously on Love Live!

Honoka: My second year of high school had only just begun, but suddenly our school is facing closure!

Honoka: My high school career is. It's all gonna go away.

Honoka: To keep this school from closing it's doors forever, we gotta get enrollment enough.
I figured out the best way we do that is to form a school idol group and get this place publicity. But...

Umi: No School Idols.

Eli: Give up this idea of yours and focus on what you can do for yourselves.

Honoka: But I still want to do something for my school. I can't just give up! I'll do this, watch me!


Eli: Good morning. What do you want?

Honoka: We would like to ask permission to use the auditorium.

Umi: The student handbook clearly states that students of this school are permitted to use the auditorium for purposes besides club activities.

Nozomi: And their requesting in after school on the day of the welcome party.

Eli: What are you planning to do then?

Umi: Ah well we're...

Honoka: A live-show.

Honoka: The three of us decided. We wanna become school idols. And we're gonna hold our debut concert in the auditorium.

Umi: Honoka...

Kotori: Um...I'm not sure we'll be quite able to do that...

Honoka: Hun? Yeah we will.

Umi: Now hang on. We're not exactly stage-ready, you know?

Eli: Excuse me. Are you ready or not?

Honoka: Yes, we totally will be.

Eli: Because the school's welcome party isn't just for a fun.

Nozomi: Well, they did only come to get permission to use the auditorium.

Nozomi: They're not even in a club, so the student council doesn't have any room to give colorful commentary on their request.

Eli: Well, no but...

Honoka, Umi, Kotori: Excuse us.

Honoka: Score!

Eli: What are you doing. Taking their side?

Nozomi: It's what they guided me to do.

Nozomi: The cards, I mean.

Nozomi: The cards are compelling me to to do so!

(Opening Song)

Umi: I already explained all this to you. It'll be way easier to get whatever we need if we don't mention the idol's stuff.

Honoka: Yeah but why?

Umi: What's with all the bread?

Honoka: My family sells Japanese sweets so this is like a rare delicacy.

Umi: It's not even lunch yet. It'll make you fat.

Honoka: Yeah.

123: Hey!

123: We saw the bulletin board. You're really gonna become school idols?

Umi: What?

123: Umi, I didn't think that was your style.

Umi: Did you post something on the bulletin board?

Honoka: About the concert.


Umi: I can't believe you.

Umi: You are way too optimistic. We only have one month to prepare and we haven't learnt anything yet.

Honoka: But I asked Kotori and she said it'll be OK.

Kotori: This maybe...

Umi: Kotori?

Kotori: Yeah, that will do it.

Kotori: Look it. How about this as a costume for the concert.

Honoka: So cute!

Kotori: You think?

Kotori: The curving part could be kind of tricky to make, but I'm gonna trying to give my best shot.

Umi: Wait, Kotori...

Kotori: What do you think, Umi?

Umi: Um...

Honoka: Super cute, right?

Umi: ...Well this long part going down right here is...

Kotori: Our legs.

Umi: We are going to wear tiny skirts and show our bare legs?

Kotori: Yeah, we're idols.

Honoka: It's all good! Besides, your legs aren't (that thicky?), Umi.

Umi: You won't talk, Honoka!

Honoka: Well...fine. Time for a diet.

Kotori: I really don't think either of you need to worry.

Honoka: We still gotta decide on a whole bunch of really important stuff, autograph style, how to keep a low profile walking around town...

Umi: That's not important at all.

Kotori: Yeah, you're right.

Kotori: Before any of that stuff, our group needs a name.

Umi&Honoka: Ah!


Honoka: I'm totally drawing a blank over here you, guys.

Kotori: I know, right, I wish we had a characteristic that stood out but...

Umi: Yeah, I guess we are all pretty different from each other...

Honoka: Well...maybe we could just use our names then?

Honoka, Umi, Kotori: Introducing! Hiya! Honoka! Umi! Kotori!

Umi: Makes me think of comedians.

Honoka: Yeah, so much...I got it!

Honoka: Umi, You're sea. Kotori, You're Air. And I'm Land.

Honoka: Together, we're Land, Sea, and Air.

Honoka, Umi, Kotori: Defending the peace of our country.

Kotori: It doesn't sound very idoly.

Honoka: No, I know...Ah...Um...Maybe...Oh, That's it!

Honoka: Looks perfect.

Umi: No, it's up to others.

Honoka: Yeah why not? I bet it'll draw more attention this way.

Kotori: Let's hope so.

Honoka: Now! Next step is dancing and singing practice.


Students: Yeah!

Honoka: It's no good. We'd probably get in people's way out here.

Honoka: Ah, jeez. The gym is jam-packed as well.

Kotori: I guess they keep it locked.

Umi: So I guess using a classroom is not an option.

A teacher: An empty class room? What do you need one for?

Honoka: Practice for our school idol live-show.

A teacher: School idols? You three?

Honoka: Nah… It's not funny.

Honoka: Well…

Umi: This is the only place left.

Kotori: There is no shade and we're kinda in a trouble if it rains but I guess we can far too be picky.

Honoka: Uh-huh. But at least we won't have to worry about making too much noise up here. Come on! It's about time we got started.

Honoka: Let's begin with our song.

Umi and Kotori: Okay!

Kotori: Ah...What's song?

Umi: Why don't you ask Honoka?

Honoka: Oh yeah...

Hanayo: Ah...Idols.

Rin: Hey Kayo! Nyan!

Hanayo: Hi Rin.

Rin: What's going on?

Hanayo: Oh...um... Actually nothing really.

Rin: Well, come on let's go.

Hanayo: Okay.

Nico: What is this?

Honoka's mother: Oh! Hi hello there Umi.

Umi: Hi! good evening. Is Honoka home?

Honoka's mother: She's up stairs. Would you care for a little dango?

Umi: No, but thanks anyway. I actually just started diet.

Honoka and Kotori: Good job for working hard today.

Honoka: How about some dango?

Kotori: Oh and a cup of tea.

Umi: How are you enjoying your diet?

Honoka and Kotori: Ahhhh!

Umi: (sighing) Are you guys gonna put any real effort into this or what? And what about the song we are supposed to perform?

Honoka: The other day, I found a first year who's got talent for days. She is an awesome singer and plays piano and all that she can compose great songs. I'm gonna go find her tomorrow and ask her.

Kotori: We were thinking if she could write music for us. Then, our priority would come up with something for the lyrics.

Umi: Something? Like what?

Honoka: Hmm...now!

Kotori: Uh-huh.

Umi: Why are you staring at me?

Honoka: Hey, Umi. Do you remember how in middle school you always used to write poems and stuff?

Umi: What?

Kotori: Yeah, you let us read them sometimes. They were so good.

Honoka: She's getting away!

Kotori: Oh no!

Umi: No, get off, Honoka! Leaving! Let me go!

Kotori: Why not?

Umi: Not writing!

Umi: No way! Not do on it!

Honoka: What!? Oh come on! Why?

Kotori: Yeah.

Umi: Absolutely not! All those poems I wrote in middle school are too embarrassing to even think about.

Honoka: They say idols have to throw away their shame though.

Umi: No they don't!

Kotori: But, Umi I have my hands full making our outfits.

Umi: Then, Honoka can figure out lyrics. I mean this whole idol thing is your idea.

Honoka: Yeah, but I'm not... I don't like manjuu. It makes you wanna throw up. Dango is gross too.

Kotori: You know, she's crapper writing.

Umi: That's true.

Kotori: Oh, please. You are the only one who can.

Honoka: And we both help you out with it. Can you at least do a base for something we can use?

Kotori: Umi, pretty please!

Umi: Fine. It's unfair but you win.

Honoka and Kotori: Oh, right!

Honoka: I knew we can count on you, Umi.

Umi: However, I'll be taking charge of our practice schedule to the concert.

Honoka and Kotori: Practice schedule?

Umi: Looks like fun, right? But they are constantly moving, they never run out of breath, and they are always smiling. They've got incredible stamina. Honoka, would you demonstrate some pushups for us if you don't mind?

Honoka: Huh? Like this?

Umi: Very good. Now, give us a smile.

Honoka: Sure thing.

Umi: Now, can you do them both at the same time?

Umi: I should be fine because at least I'm in archery. But you two have really got to work on your stamina so you can maintain your smile while you're performing.

Kotori: Who knew. Being an idol is pretty hard work.

Umi: Well, let's start.

Honoka: I'm dying. Five laps is too much.

Kotori: My legs won't work any more.

Umi: Starting today, every moring and evening, in addition to rehearsal, you will participate in physical training.

Honoka and Kotori: Twice a day!?

Umi: You heard me. If we're putting on a concert, we're going to do this right. Otherwise, we won't be able to attract any new students.

Honoka: Yeah.

Umi: All right. You're ready for another set?

Honoka: Okay!

Nozomi: Good afternoon.

Kotori: Vice president?

Honoka: Isn't that outfit...

Nozomi: I sometimes help out around here. You know, as a spiritual place, a shrine gathers all sorts of energies. Since you're using the stairs here for training, you should think about paying a visit to the shrine.

Honoka: May our first concert be a great success.

Honoka, Kotori, Umi: May be a great success.

Nozomi: Sounds like they mean it. Guess they are not fooling around.

Honoka: What up all you, first year students. I'm your school idol, Honoka Kosaka. Hold on, don't they all know who I am know?

Umi: No, why would they?

Kotori: Anyway, which one is the girl you said is good at piano and singing?

Honoka: Her! There you are! You got a minute?

Maki: What's for?

Maki: No way I refuse.

Honoka: Oh please! We'd really love you to be our composer.

Maki: I said I refuse.

Honoka: Oh! Maybe you just sing and play but you're not actually a composer?

Maki: Of course I can compose, but I'm not going to help you out so give it a rest

Honoka: We're trying to attract students to our school if we could use one of your sounds...

Maki: Not interested.

Honoka: No way, I refused. that's great. Sounds like you, Umi.

Umi: Seems pretty normal to me

Honoka: And after you wrote such nice lyrics too.

Umi: What's a... Hey! Why did you!

Honoka: But we're gonna sing it in front of everyone once we have the music

Umi: (?) until we do.

Honoka: Oh, How long, Ms. President?

Eli: Can I borrow you for a second?

Teacher: Now then when both A and B are real numbers the sum of a + bi is known as a complex number...

Honoka: We might have the opposite effect.

Eli: Just think about it. We've never had a school idol here before.How is it going to look to everyone if we try and end up failing miserably at it. I'd rather not see our school close either and I really mean that she had better not be taking all of this lightly.

Honoka: Maybe she's right. Maybe I haven't been taking this whole thing very seriously.

Umi: Took you long enough to realize it.

Honoka: I didn't come up with this plan of some kind of joke.I'm following the practice schedule you made out for us.My legs are super sore because of it.

Umi: I don't doubt it, Honoka. I know you're trying hard but give them careful consideration to what the student council president said.

Honoka: Yeah I have but we've only got less than a month now.

Kotori: If we're really putting on a concert, we only at least figure out our song.

Umi: Now we run out of time to look for another composer. we might have to resort to just singing a cover of a song from some other Idol group.

Kotori: I guess you are right.

Honoka: Yeah.

123: How goes the training?

123: Just let us know if there's anything we can help you with for the concert.

123: Yeah, like the lighting or ushering you're pretty blowing, right?

Honoka: You mean it?

123: Of course!

123: After all, you guys are doing all of this for our school.

123: Everyone in our class agrees that we should all do our part.

Honoka: Well, that's great news.

123: Good luck with everything.

Honoka: Thanks so much. See you later!

123: Later!

Honoka: Huh? Ah!

Umi: We got one?

Kotori: Like for real?

Honoka: Right, here! One!

Honoka: Use?

Umi: No, I think it reads Muse.

Honoka: Like for your hair, you mean?

Umi: No, not mousse. The muses are from Greek mythology, goddesses of the Arts, I think.

Kotori: I think it's a sweet name. I really like it!

Honoka: Muse, huh?

Honoka: As of today, we are now called Muse!

Student: I hear they're always practicing on the roof

Student: I never thought the school actually had an idol group.

Rin: Nya, Kayo, are you ready to go?

Hanayo: Yeah.

Honoka: Nobody's here.

Rin: Meow?

Honoka: Hey, where is that girl?

Rin: Which girl?

Hanayo: Nishikino, you mean, the really good singer?

Honoka: Yeah, that's the one! Would you tell me her name again?

Hanayo: Maki, Ms. Maki Nishikino.

Honoka: Too bad, I really wanted to have a chat with her but I think she's already had it for home. Just my luck!

Rin: She might be in the music room.

Honoka: Really, you think so?

Rin: Yeah cuz she seems to keep to herself most of the time. She's always in the library during breaks and goes to the music room after school.

Honoka: Oh I gotcha. Well, thanks again you guys!

Hanayo: Ah, wait!

Honoka: Huh?

Hanayo: Ah, good luck being an idol. You'll be great.

Honoka: Yeah, thank you!

Maki: What do you want now?

Honoka: Oh you know I just thought I'd ask you again.

Maki: You sure are persistent.

Honoka: That's one way of putting it. Umi always telling me that I'm stubborn.

Maki: The thing is, I don't even listen to that type of music I prefer classical and jazz.

Honoka: Really? Why is that?

Maki: Pop music is lame. It's got no substance. The artist just goof around.

Honoka: Yeah that's true.

Maki: Huh?

Honoka: I used to feel the same way, you know, that it would be easy to become a big star! And we just party all the time and have fun singing and we're in cute clothes but actually it's been really hard work.

Honoka: Hey, can you do any push-ups?

Maki: What?

Honoka: Oh, I'm sorry.

Maki: Well, of course, I can do damn push-ups.

Maki: One, two, three... Are you satisfied?

Honoka: Well, you're strong. You can do way more than me!

Maki: Of course I can. You may not be able to tell...

Honoka: OK, now do with smiling.

Maki: What? Smiling?

Honoka: Yeah, let's see it!

Honoka: See? Being an idol's not so easy.

Maki: What are you talking about?

Maki: You are nuts.

Honoka: Here, lyrics. Can you at least read them one.

Maki: I already told you, right?

Honoka: Reading them can't hurt right? I'll ask you what you think later if you still don't want to do it after that I'll leave you all alone.

Maki: Just don't get your hopes that my answer is not gonna change.

Honoka: Well it's okay if it doesn't. As a consolation, let me listen to you sing again?

Maki: Huh?

Honoka: You see I really love your voice, Ms. Nishikino. That's why I'm asking you to compose for us because your music truly moved me I mean it.

Honoka: We train at the local shrine every morning and evening, so drop by and check it out if you'd like.

Honoka: You see, I really love your voice, Ms. Nishikino.

Honoka: Hey, gets stop, please!

Kotori: I think I...

Umi: That's too bad. You both got two laps to go still or are you just going to give up?

Honoka: Umi, you're any of tiring?

Umi: I think (?).

Honoka: Did you hear that?

Kotori: Yeah.

Maki: Get your hands off!

Nozomi: Oh, my, It seems you still got some growing to do.

Maki: Hey!

Nozomi: But don't you give up hope just yet there's still time. You still have plenty of room to grow.

Maki: Have room for what?

Nozomi: If you're too embarrassed or something you can always try to subtle approach.

Maki: Subtle? What are you talking...

Nozomi: You know what I mean.

Honoka: See you later!

Yukiho: Hey, Honoka. Is all the stuff for you? It's not addressed to anyone. It just says "Muse" on it.

Honoka: What?

Honoka: Huh? Ah... really?

Honoka: Here goes.

Honoka: That voice, could it be.

Honoka: She did it. It's real song.

Kotori: And it's our song.

Umi: Our very own song.

Umi: A vote?

Honoka: C'mon! We got a practice!

Umi and Kotori: Yeah!

MC: Next time on Love Live! "First Concert!"
When the cherry trees blossom, their petals fall like flakes of snow. A little while ago, I had an encounter on the night full of falling cherry blossom petals that changed my life forever.

She is smart, she is pretty, and she is really good at any kind of art, music, well, just about everything. Not to mention, she gets really awesome grades, everybody likes her. She is perfect when you think about it?

Naru!

My name is Naru Sekiya.

Yaya!

Hey! Good morning!

You're so cool! I heard about you winning the writing competition the other day.

Oh, yeah, and you're still writing awesome lyrics for the band while you're at it, too.

Come on, I just got lucky, okay?

Uh, sorry, Naru. See you guys after school!

Okay. Alright. Later!

Come on.

Of course, I'm nowhere near as perfect as my friend Yaya is... I'm average in every sense of the word. I'm an average 14-year-old. Average to everything. I was hoping that something was just gonna magically change for me once I started middle school. No luck there I guess.

<music>

What do you think?

Mm-Hmm! Wow! You guys are really incredible just now!

We've really been having a lot of energy. We've been talking about heading one of the major group auditions.

Oh, wow, an audition!? But what'd you start a band for, Yaya? Do you really like music that much?

Well, it's cool to be in a band, isn't it? And yeah, I've always wanted to play. And it's always more fun to do what you wanna do, right? You gotta agree, don't you?

Oh, shoot! I totally forgot my dad wants me to come home early today, Yaya. And I still need to go get this book back to the library.

You're still reading [this] fairy tales?

Huh? But they're really good, Yaya. This one's about a cute fairy who goes and saves her girlfriend...

Okay, okay. I get you still like fairy tales, and shouldn't you be going now?

Ah? Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? So, do what you wanna do, huh? Yaya is just so amazing, and I'm...

Oh.

Oh, hey, dad.

I see you've finally made it back home. Do you remember I told you to come back early? What were you doing?

Uh, I went to the library, and then I...

Yeah, OK. So you went to library probably checking in on getting another fairy tale book just like you did in grade school. Won't you want to do something else with yourself? Forget it. Anyway, I need you to take this bag and go on over the Nishimikado's. I remember to mind your manners around them, alright?

Thank you for coming all this way, but I'm sorry, my dear, the master hasn't quite made it home yet.

If it isn't Naru?

Huh?!

Big sister Tami.

You have something for my... father? Thank you for taking the trouble.

A-Ahhh...

I'd really like to invite you in but... I'm keeping my English teacher waiting in there. English is a really good thing to learn even if I DON'T study in a national business. And make sure you take care getting home. There's a Kagura performance at the shrine today, so it's really clouded out there.

Hey! Get off of that!

I'm okay, four eyes!

You wanna go to junior ones, small brat!?

One time when I was a little girl, I went to a big movie theater. There was a heroine who had nothing but rags to wear, but she ended up meeting a fairy godmother who made her over into a beautiful princess. And then she met a prince. I thought all that in just maybe want to be that dazzling myself! My heart started dancing at the thought of it. That someone's gonna take me away from this world someday. I feel waiting for it, believing of it's gonna happen to me. What was my fairy gonna come and make me into someone special. if it can happen to her, it can happen to me... Is she a fairy? Uh, wait, are you a... Ahh?! Come back! Wait! Don't run away! Please don't go without me, Miss Fairy!

Huh? Who's Miss Fairy? Uh, hey there, is there a reason you're chasing me?

Uh, uh, well I was just hoping you my... you... just look so pretty! And magical like a fairy! So I thought and I was kinda hoping that you might take me to another world or something like that.

Well, if you want. Yeah, I'll take you away. If that's what your heart is yearning for, then let's go to a new world. But first, wouldn't you join me in a little dance? How about that?

Huh? You want me to what? I've never done anything like that before.

It's okay, just twirl around, and twirl around, and don't forget to have some fun, okay? Here we... go!

Her smile is beautiful. Long lashes, huge eyes, and she's so tiny. And her voice, so clear and sweet. Everybody else will definitely call her a heroine in anyone's story...

Ah! Awww...

I just can't. I really can't do this. I'm sorry I troubled you, okay?

Huh!? But... but, why!?

Uh... well, it's... because I'm... not dazzling enough.

What?

I'm really sorry. I gotta get home now!

Hey, wait a sec, please don't run away! I'm not really sure what you meant by all that, but you can be really dazzling if you want! Anybody can if they try! Just wait for me to find you. I promise I'm gonna find you and help you, okay?

No one's ever said anything like that to me before. Me, the girl who can't do anything, just stuck in my average world doing nothing. I'm really... oh my kidding... I can't go out and dazzle anyone. So, what's this catches, anyway?

Oh, wow, it is so late... Ehahhhh!?

Uh, sorry. Are you gonna be okay, there?

What did you do that for?!? You're psycho!?

Well, I'm kind of running away from somebody...

You there! Stop running around like that!

Sorry about that. Gotta go! (?)(?)!

(police man) What are you doing?! (?)(?) Walk on the sidewalk, you menace!

What a minute! Was that a kiddie ghost? Oh, check this out, Naru. You won't believe what happened to me yesterday.

Yeah? What was it?

Well, I was at the tracks , and...

All right! Let's take your seats, everyone! I got a new student to introduce you today.

Ah!

And that's not just any new student. She's come all the way from America, and transferred in to be with us this year. And so, why don't you go ahead introduce yourself?

Hey there, nice to meet you! Like the sensei said, I'm American from Princeton, New Jersey. My name is Hana N Fountainstand. And I absolutely love being in Japan! I'm so happy to be here. I really can't express it right. I wanna get you know every one of you as soon as I can, so don't be afraid to come and... Wha~!

What is she!?

Ah! I knew I was gonna find you but not as soon! Good to see you! I was hoping we meet up again! I'm here to take you away, just like you want it! By the way, you can call me Hana. But I gotta ask you one thing, remember what I said, we're gonna dance Yosakoi!

<eye catch> Crumple...

Yeah, I'll take you away. If that's what your heart is yearning for, then let's go to a new world. I'll take you to a world like nothing you've ever seen before! It's time! ...to tell you some for the pronto, because once you going my spaceship we're never coming back here!

Eh~~???

Let's ride the stars! Hehehehehehe~!

(Eek!) Get away from me! Such chasing me already I told you yesterday I didn't want to do it!

We got it dance Yosakoi!

Does she know her?

Yosakoi...

I-I can't, you okay?

Huh~!? Don't you remember I promised I was gonna take you away from all this? If you take just spare a moment of your time, and get the benefit!

No, thank you~~!!!! Huh!? Oh, hey, Tami!

So, what's wrong with them?

Are you okay?

You know her?

Oh no. It's gonna get rumors stalking along in the place!

Yo~sa~ko~i~! Hey! Come on, pig tales! Where do you run off to?

Well, somebody hasn't given up yet? Looks like you got a fan girl.

Awww...

So, have you told her your feel yet?

Don't funny, Yaya. I swear I'm gonna just die of my embarrassment before the day's over!

Hahaha! Ahh~! I guess I'd die too, after all that princely courting behavior! When you think about it, I don't think it'd be that bad for you. What was it, Yosakoi dancing?

Huh?

You know if you try it but you even like it, I think it's like dancing around and cosplay or something.

Huh!?

Can I have a little sip of that?

It's like everybody just has to keep on staring when she talks me...

Yeah, I guess being the some of attention isn't your thing. Even I think it's cute how easily you blush, though.

Ah! Well, I've got a ask you.

?

You think you could come with me when I tell her the interest now I know really don't want to? Is that okay?

... ! What?! I'm not gonna do that!

Come on! If you don't help me, she's gonna drag me out to the spaceship to who knows where!?

What spaceship? Being around itty-clingy people like that just stressed me out the world. And the girl already owes me to the pain she put me through at the tracks. Here's a but, go join the club or something, so you can just tell her you don't have the time, sounds like you've got anything else going on, right?

Ahhhh!!

(hana)Hey! C'mon! Pigtails! Let's Yosakoi already!

(yaya) (?)(?)

(naru) (?)(?) do it!

A club, huh? Of course, now what's coming back to me, I tried to join the club when I first got into the academy... But when I tried, I got intimidated by all the people there. I guess I wonder what, ...kind of, why if I would've had by took that step awhile back... On the other hand, I'm pretty happy that my life hasn't changed all that much. It's not like I've got a bad life, you know? But still... Is there something else I wanna do? Oh? Haaaahhh!? Whawhawhawha~!?

Hey there~!

How long have you been there looking at my skirt!?

I finally found you! And I'm not letting you out of my sight until you let me finish talking to you this time! It's time to come with me~!

Knock it off!

Huh?

Why... why can you just listen to me? And leave me alone. I'm sure there are lot of people who dance with you if you ask! Just stop interfering with the way I'm doing things.

Would you say so... didn't you have fun with me?

Huh?

And I don't know about you miss pigtails, but I really had a lot of fun when we dance the other night. And that's why I've been thinking... about you. And maybe we can just have fun again!

I... wish, I... Well, I just wish I... I wanted to change into someone who isn't plain like I am, but I've never be able to do it! Because I...

Hey, wow, I think they're fighting.

Huh!? What!?

Oh, I've seen that girl before.

Just stop bothering me, alright?

(two girls) Really? What is she(?)(?)... Let's go. Yeah.

Sorry, I bothered you.

Huh?

Sorry about that. I think I misunderstood what you wanted and got little pushy about it. But feel free to let me know if you wanna try it sometime. See you in class tomorrow.

Huh? Huh!?!? Huh!? There's no way I could do something like that!

Didn't you have fun with me?

Sneak...

What are you doing?

Eek!

Oh, aw, hey there~! It's not like I was sneaking around~!

Huh? Well, you got a give her the aim for at first, but who's gonna join a club with someone that creepy in it?

I'm telling you it's lots of fun!

Yeah, that's okay, really.

Hey, Naru! Do you think you could take out the trash? A band's got a lot of practice to get in...

Yeah, sure. You guys got a big audition coming up.

Yeah! Naru, I owe you one big time for this!

It's okey, Yaya. Just let me breathe, haha. Huh?

Huh?

...yosakoi with me! Yosakoi~, yosakoi~! Well, we'll have fun! (?)(?)

Ah, a little pest. Seriously, Naru, is she just gonna keep on rousing people until some hard luck who's joined up with her?

Yeah, she's busy...

I mean, look at the flier she made. She isn't gonna attract anyone like that? That might as well being crayon. Naru?

Yeah, you got a point, I guess. Alright. It's not like I'm joining her club. I'm just giving this back to her. That's it. It's not like I'm interested or anything. Ah!

? Oh, hey there. This is great! You really changed your mind after all!

Uh, no! It doesn't it, at all! I just came to give this back to you.

Awww, well, that's awfully nice of you. But you know what, I really like you to keep it, okay?

Huh?

If it got you even a little bit of interested in Yosakoi, I'll be really happy knowing what it did. Make it keep sake, 'kay?

Ah!

What's wrong?

How long are you gonna keep on doing this thingy? I don't think anyone's gonna come join your club, you know? And everyone around campus is...

I know.

Ah?

They can look at me funny all they want, but it's my dream to dance Yosakoi. Everyone else can go act like they've got better things to do. But it's valorous! I'm gonna keep on doing this until I find someone to dance with me. It was a while ago, my parents brought me to Japan on vacation when I was a little girl, and I saw Yosakoi for the first time, and I would never forget how colorful and powerful it was. I knew I wanted to dance with them someday... to be dazzling, like those dancers. Now that I'm back in my beloved Japan, I wanna do Yosakoi with everyone. You may know if I work hard, and make the dream I had is a little girl into reality. I knew it! That's why I can work it out all the time! To fight for a dream, that's enough to make me happy on its own.

I... really don't get you at all.

Ah...

I guess it's awesome, perhaps something you love like you do. But, some people in this world are just really empty like I am.

Well then, it looks like you owe it to yourself a lot of fun. Think about it: if your energy that's all to mean you've got lots of room to put a lot of happy stuff in. Thing's little fun, precious, painful...but mostly new and exciting!

B-But...

Oh, yeah! It's gonna be awesome! Just you wait! I told you before, "anyone can be dazzling if they try hard enough!"

I've got to say it.

Huh?

I really... had fun, too! ...When I danced with you, I had fun. I'll admit it, I really had fun with you!

Eh!?

For the first time, I thought maybe I could be dazzling, too! I really felt that way... Do you think I can just help you with the club!? ...like... a friend, who helps you out!? Huh? I mean it's not like I can dance in front of the people or anything yet, but I can help you find new members or something like that. I... can't...? Huh!?

Huh? You really want to help me out!? I'm so happy that you want to!

Huh!?

I finally made my first friend in Japan! But you got to tell me your name.

Huh? Naru. It's Naru Sekiya.

Naru... Wouldn't you really pretty name you have!? Let me ask you again, would you like to join me and doing Yosakoi, Naru?

Ah! Huh!? Wait! I'll help! I'm only helping you! Not dancing!

I've started to learn how to do Yosakoi!

I won't let you get away now, Naru! Tee-hee!

Oh, now I kinda wanna quit!

Oh no!
